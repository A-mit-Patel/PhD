  abstract = {Phase I cancer clinical trials are small dose-finding studies designed to rapidly identify the optimal dose of a new anticancer agent. The optimal dose has been defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for conventional cytotoxic anticancer drugs, and this dose is typically recommended as the phase II dose. In the past two decades, a new approach for cancer treatment has emerged. This approach, now widely referred to as molecularly targeted therapy is designed a priori, based on the knowledge of various physiological molecules that have been obtained by the development of molecular biology. Most molecularly targeted agents slow or stop the growth of tumors. Such agents are, in general, less toxic than conventional cytotoxic agents; as a result, the maximum therapeutic effect may occur at doses well below the MTD. With the emergence of a growing number of molecularly targeted agents, approaches to early drug development are changing. We present dose-finding designs for phase I clinical trials of molecularly targeted drugs. There is an increasing need to develop designs to find the optimal biological dose (OBD) for molecularly targeted agents, and the utility of designs needs to be prospectively evaluated in future clinical dose-finding trials for a variety of molecularly targeted agents.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of immunotherapy and other novel therapies, the traditional assumption that the efficacy of the study drug increases monotonically with dose levels is not always true. Therefore, dose-finding methods evaluating only toxicity data may not be adequate. In this paper, we have first compared the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) and Toxicity Equivalence Range (TEQR) dose-finding oncology designs for safety with identical stopping rules; we have then extended both designs to include efficacy in addition to safety – we determine the optimal dose for safety and efficacy using these designs by applying isotonic regression to the observed toxicity and efficacy rates, once the early phase trial is completed. We consider multiple types of underlying dose response curves, i.e., monotonically increasing, plateau, or umbrella-shaped. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the two proposed designs and compare them to existing designs. We found that the extended mTPI design selects the optimal dose for safety and efficacy more accurately than the other designs for most of the scenarios considered.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper introduces the target equivalence range (TEQR) design, a frequentist implementation of the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, as a competitor to the standard 3+3 design (3+3). The 3+3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Its main competitor, the continual reassessment method (CRM) has not found a true niche in the Phase I armamentarium resulting from statistical and implementation complexities. Methods We describe the four competing designs (3+3, mTPI, CRM, and TEQR), comparing them based on i) operating characteristics from simulated trials, and ii) ease of implementation. Results The TEQR is better than the 3+3 when compared on; 1) number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) number of patients assigned to dose levels at or nearest the MTD, 3) overall trial dose limiting toxicity rate and 4) accuracy and precision of estimates for the rate of toxicity at the MTD. Further it is reasonably comparable to the CRM and mTPI on 1–3. Conclusion The TEQR offers trial designers a competitor to the 3+3 for ease of implementation with better operating characteristics and the added attraction of a glimpse of activity at the MTD. The R package TEQR, freely available from the comprehensive R archive network, includes functions to calculate dose escalation guidelines and operating characteristics.},

The Bayesians are much fewer and until recently could only snipe at the frequentists from the high ground of university departments of mathematical statistics. Now the increasing power of computers is bringing Bayesian methods to thefore. Bayesian methods are based on the idea that unknown quantities, such as population means and proportions, have probabilitydistributions. The probability distribution for a population proportionexpresses our prior knowledge or belief about it, before we add the knowledge which comes from our data. For example, suppose we want to estimate the prevalence of diabetes in a health district. We could use the knowledge that the percentage of diabetics in the United Kingdom as a whole is about 2\%, so we expect the prevalence in our health district to be fairly similar. It is unlikely to be 10\%, for example. We might …},

In particular, the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and its variations have drawn much attention in the medical community, though it has yet to become a commonplace tool. To overcome the status quo in phase I clinical trials, statisticians must be able to design trials using the CRM in a timely and reproducible manner.   A self-contained theoretical framework of the CRM for researchers and graduate students who set out to learn and do research in the CRM and dose-finding methods in general, Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method features:    Real clinical trial examples that illustrate the methods and techniques throughout the book Detailed calibration techniques that enable biostatisticians to design a CRM in timely manner Limitations of the CRM are outlined to aid in correct use of method   This book supplies practical, efficient dose-finding methods based on cutting edge statistical research. More than just a cookbook, it provides full, unified coverage of the CRM in addition to step-by-step guidelines to automation and parameterization of the methods used on a regular basis. A detailed exposition of the calibration of the CRM for applied statisticians working with dose-finding in phase I trials, the book focuses on the R package ‘dfcrm’ for the CRM and its major variants.  The author recognizes clinicians’ skepticism of model-based designs, and addresses their concerns that the time, professional, and computational resources necessary for accurate model-based designs can be major bottlenecks to the widespread use of appropriate dose-finding methods in phase I practice. The theoretically- and empirically-based methods in Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method will lessen the statistician’s burden and encourage the continuing development and implementation of model-based dose-finding methods.},

In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics46, 33–48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2–4 years by our method.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to 9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is a Bayesian dose-finding design to address the issue of long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration, does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.},

  abstract = {The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95\% of phase I trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost, and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3 design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the 3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs. In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition, compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3 + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Background Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM. Methods The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to 70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for 4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers, the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to 79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in the phase IIa. Discussion Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as radiosensitizer. Trial registration NCT03212742, registered June, 7, 2017.

To address this issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical trials.},

We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the BOIN design not only has superior finite and large sample properties but also can be easily implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional '3+3' design. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields comparable average performance to select the maximum tolerated dose but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses.

The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle, exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an Achilles’ heel.

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},

Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples, and as far as the final recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching to the new scheme.},

  abstract = {Background Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. Methods We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx. Findings The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% CI 0·85–0·94, p{$<$}0·0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46). Interpretation Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, phase I dose-finding trials aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose of a new drug under the assumption that both toxicity and efficacy monotonically increase with the dose. This paradigm, however, is not suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus. For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose, defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose. We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose–efficacy relationship. We take the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is available for this specific setting. We also provide an R package dfmta that can be downloaded from CRAN website.},

  abstract = {Purpose Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice.   Methods We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs.   Results One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method.   Conclusion A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.},

  abstract = {Aims This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English radiotherapy dataset (RTDS). Materials and methods We reviewed the evidence base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009, accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population 91~500–1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages. Results The Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071 attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to 60~057. Discussion Services have increased their activity by 14\% between 2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with international evidence-based practice.},

  abstract = {This is the third of four articles Bayes's theorem arose from a posthumous publication in 1763 by Thomas Bayes, a non-conformist minister from Tunbridge Wells. Although it gives a simple and uncontroversial result in probability theory, specific uses of the theorem have been the subject of considerable controversy for more than two centuries. In recent years a more balanced and pragmatic perspective has emerged, and in this paper we review current thinking on the value of the Bayesian approach to health technology assessment. A concise definition of bayesian methods in health technology assessment has not been established, but we suggest the following: the explicit quantitative use of external evidence in the design, monitoring, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of a health technology assessment. This approach acknowledges that judgments about the benefits of a new technology will rarely be based solely on the results of a single study but should synthesise evidence from multiple sources—for example, pilot studies, trials of similar interventions, and even subjective judgments about the generalisability of the study's results. A bayesian perspective leads to an approach to clinical trials that is claimed to be more flexible and ethical than traditional methods,1 and to elegant ways of handling multiple substudies—for example, when simultaneously estimating the effects of a treatment on many subgroups.2 Proponents have also argued that a bayesian approach allows conclusions to be provided in a form that is most suitable for decisions specific to patients and decisions affecting public policy.3 \#\#\#\# Summary points Bayesian methods interpret data from a study in the light of external evidence and judgment, and the form in which conclusions are drawn contributes naturally to decision making Prior plausibility of hypotheses is taken into account, just as when interpreting the results of a diagnostic test Scepticism about large treatment effects can be formally …},

To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papilloma virus was detectable by sequencing of DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.},

The method requires that each of the two agents has been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.},

  abstract = {Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990,\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders.},

The continual reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM. We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings, formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection and stopping rules, are also discussed.

Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM) was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of the trial.},

Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%, particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising on other operating characteristics.},

The CRM has been shown to be more accurate in targeting the MTD than traditional rule-based approaches such as the 3\,+\,3 design, which is used in most phase I trials. Furthermore, the CRM has been shown to assign more trial participants at or close to the MTD than the 3\,+\,3 design. However, the CRM’s uptake in clinical research has been incredibly slow, putting trial participants, drug development and patients at risk. Barriers to increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available. Furthermore, practical resources to support clinicians considering the CRM for their trials are scarce.},

The original design was proposed by Wages and Tait in 2015 for trials of molecularly targeted agents in cancer treatments, where dose-efficacy assumptions are not always monotonically increasing. Our goal is to improve the design’s overall performance regarding the estimation of optimal dose as well as patient allocation to effective treatments. The proposed methods calculate randomization probabilities based on the likelihood of every candidate model as opposed to the original design which selects the best model and then randomizes doses based on estimations from the selected model. Unlike the original method, our proposed adaption does not require an arbitrarily specified sample size for the adaptive randomization stage. Simulations are used to compare the proposed strategies and a final strategy is recommended. Under most scenarios, our recommended method allocates more patients to the optimal dose while improving accuracy in selecting the final optimal dose without increasing the overall risk of toxicity.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.

  abstract = {Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.},

Agents with specific biologic targets and limited toxicity require novel designs to determine doses to be taken forward into larger studies. In this paper, we describe an approach that incorporates both toxicity and efficacy data into the estimation of the biologically optimal dose of an agent in a phase I trial. The approach is based on the flexible continuation-ratio model, and uses straightforward optimal dose selection criteria. Dose selection is based on all patients treated up until that time point, using a continual reassessment method approach. Dose–outcome curves considered include monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and unimodal curves.

  abstract = {In the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the objective of dose finding is often to identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), rather than the maximum tolerated dose. We develop a utility-based Bayesian optimal interval (U-BOIN) phase I/II design to find the OBD. We jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a multinomial-Dirichlet model, and employ a utility function to measure dose risk-benefit trade-off. The U-BOIN design consists of two seamless stages. In stage I, the Bayesian optimal interval design is used to quickly explore the dose space and collect preliminary toxicity and efficacy data. In stage II, we continuously update the posterior estimate of the utility for each dose after each cohort, using accumulating efficacy and toxicity from both stages I and II, and then use the posterior estimate to direct the dose assignment and selection. Compared to existing phase I/II designs, one prominent advantage of the U-BOIN design is its simplicity for implementation. Once the trial is designed, it can be easily applied using predetermined decision tables, without complex model fitting and estimation. Our simulation study shows that, despite its simplicity, the U-BOIN design is robust and has high accuracy to identify the OBD. We extend the design to accommodate delayed efficacy by leveraging the short-term endpoint (eg, immune activity or other biological activity of targeted agents), and using it to predict the delayed efficacy outcome to facilitate real-time decision making. A user-friendly software to implement the U-BOIN is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.},
