  abstract = {Phase I cancer clinical trials are small dose-finding studies designed to rapidly identify the optimal dose of a new anticancer agent. The optimal dose has been defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for conventional cytotoxic anticancer drugs, and this dose is typically recommended as the phase II dose. In the past two decades, a new approach for cancer treatment has emerged. This approach, now widely referred to as molecularly targeted therapy is designed a priori, based on the knowledge of various physiological molecules that have been obtained by the development of molecular biology. Most molecularly targeted agents slow or stop the growth of tumors. Such agents are, in general, less toxic than conventional cytotoxic agents; as a result, the maximum therapeutic effect may occur at doses well below the MTD. With the emergence of a growing number of molecularly targeted agents, approaches to early drug development are changing. We present dose-finding designs for phase I clinical trials of molecularly targeted drugs. There is an increasing need to develop designs to find the optimal biological dose (OBD) for molecularly targeted agents, and the utility of designs needs to be prospectively evaluated in future clinical dose-finding trials for a variety of molecularly targeted agents.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of immunotherapy and other novel therapies, the traditional assumption that the efficacy of the study drug increases monotonically with dose levels is not always true. Therefore, dose-finding methods evaluating only toxicity data may not be adequate. In this paper, we have first compared the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) and Toxicity Equivalence Range (TEQR) dose-finding oncology designs for safety with identical stopping rules; we have then extended both designs to include efficacy in addition to safety – we determine the optimal dose for safety and efficacy using these designs by applying isotonic regression to the observed toxicity and efficacy rates, once the early phase trial is completed. We consider multiple types of underlying dose response curves, i.e., monotonically increasing, plateau, or umbrella-shaped. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the two proposed designs and compare them to existing designs. We found that the extended mTPI design selects the optimal dose for safety and efficacy more accurately than the other designs for most of the scenarios considered.},

The work is written from the authors s committed Bayesian perspective, but an overview of non-Bayesian theories is also provided, and each chapter contains a wide-ranging critical re-examination of controversial issues. The level of mathematics used is such that most material is accessible to readers with knowledge of advanced calculus. In particular, no knowledge of abstract measure theory is assumed, and the emphasis throughout is on statistical concepts rather than rigorous mathematics. The book will be an ideal source for all students and researchers in statistics, mathematics, decision analysis, economic and business studies, and all branches of science and engineering, who wish to further their understanding of Bayesian statistics},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper introduces the target equivalence range (TEQR) design, a frequentist implementation of the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, as a competitor to the standard 3+3 design (3+3). The 3+3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Its main competitor, the continual reassessment method (CRM) has not found a true niche in the Phase I armamentarium resulting from statistical and implementation complexities. Methods We describe the four competing designs (3+3, mTPI, CRM, and TEQR), comparing them based on i) operating characteristics from simulated trials, and ii) ease of implementation. Results The TEQR is better than the 3+3 when compared on; 1) number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) number of patients assigned to dose levels at or nearest the MTD, 3) overall trial dose limiting toxicity rate and 4) accuracy and precision of estimates for the rate of toxicity at the MTD. Further it is reasonably comparable to the CRM and mTPI on 1–3. Conclusion The TEQR offers trial designers a competitor to the 3+3 for ease of implementation with better operating characteristics and the added attraction of a glimpse of activity at the MTD. The R package TEQR, freely available from the comprehensive R archive network, includes functions to calculate dose escalation guidelines and operating characteristics.},

The frequentists are much the larger group, and almost all the statistical analyses which appear in the BMJ are frequentist. The Bayesians are much fewer and until recently could only snipe at the frequentists from the high ground of university departments of mathematical statistics. Now the increasing power of computers is bringing Bayesian methods to thefore. Bayesian methods are based on the idea that unknown quantities, such as population means and proportions, have probabilitydistributions. The probability distribution for a population proportionexpresses our prior knowledge or belief about it, before we add the knowledge which comes from our data. For example, suppose we want to estimate the prevalence of diabetes in a health district. We could use the knowledge that the percentage of diabetics in the United Kingdom as a whole is about 2\%, so we expect the prevalence in our health district to be fairly similar. It is unlikely to be 10\%, for example. We might …},

We call our study design bCRM, for bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and distributions to use with a bivariate study design.},

  abstract = {Due to the staggered entry of subjects in phase I trials, some subjects will only be partially through the study when others are ready to be enrolled. Nonetheless, many phase I designs focus solely upon whether or not subjects experience toxicity, thereby determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with a binomial likelihood using data from fully observed subjects. The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was the first attempt to incorporate information from partially observed subjects by using a weighted binomial likelihood in which the weights are based upon the actual toxicity time distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately estimate the toxicity time distribution because only a small proportion of enrolled subjects will experience toxicity. Creators of the TITE-CRM propose the simple alternative of weighting subjects by the proportion of time observed, as well as two adaptive weights to adjust for late-onset toxicities. As a alternative to these approaches, we suggest assuming the toxicity times, as a proportion of the total time under observation, have a Beta distribution with parameters 1.0 and theta; we also allow theta to vary by dose. The value of theta allows us to reflect the occurrence of early- or late-onset toxicities without correctly specifying the actual distribution of toxicity times. Through this model, we do not necessarily expect to improve identification of the MTD, but rather hope to reduce the exposure of subjects to overly toxic doses. Through simulation, we examine how well our model identifies the MTD and allocates dose assignments in three scenarios investigated by previous publications.},

  abstract = {As the temporal, financial, and ethical cost of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) continues to rise, researchers and regulators in drug discovery and development face increasing pressure to make better use of existing data sources. This pressure is especially high in rare disease, where traditionally designed RCTs are often infeasible due to the inability to recruit enough patients or the unwillingness of patients or trial leaders to randomly assign anyone to placebo. Bayesian statistical methods have recently been recommended in such settings for their ability to combine disparate data sources, increasing overall study power. The use of these methods has received a boost in the United States thanks to a new willingness by regulators at the Food and Drug Administration to consider complex innovative trial designs. These designs allow trialists to change the nature of the trial (eg, stop early for success or futility, drop an underperforming trial arm, incorporate data on historical controls, etc) while it is still running. In this article, we review a broad collection of Bayesian techniques useful in rare disease research, indicating the benefits and risks associated with each. We begin with relatively innocuous methods for combining information from RCTs and proceed on through increasingly innovative approaches that borrow strength from increasingly heterogeneous and less carefully curated data sources. We also offer 2 examples from the very recent literature illustrating how clinical pharmacology principles can make important contributions to such designs, confirming the interdisciplinary nature of this work.},

  abstract = {As clinicians begin to realize the important role of dose-finding in the drug development process, there is an increasing openness to "novel" methods proposed in the past two decades. In particular, the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and its variations have drawn much attention in the medical community, though it has yet to become a commonplace tool. To overcome the status quo in phase I clinical trials, statisticians must be able to design trials using the CRM in a timely and reproducible manner.   A self-contained theoretical framework of the CRM for researchers and graduate students who set out to learn and do research in the CRM and dose-finding methods in general, Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method features:    Real clinical trial examples that illustrate the methods and techniques throughout the book Detailed calibration techniques that enable biostatisticians to design a CRM in timely manner Limitations of the CRM are outlined to aid in correct use of method   This book supplies practical, efficient dose-finding methods based on cutting edge statistical research. More than just a cookbook, it provides full, unified coverage of the CRM in addition to step-by-step guidelines to automation and parameterization of the methods used on a regular basis. A detailed exposition of the calibration of the CRM for applied statisticians working with dose-finding in phase I trials, the book focuses on the R package ‘dfcrm’ for the CRM and its major variants.  The author recognizes clinicians’ skepticism of model-based designs, and addresses their concerns that the time, professional, and computational resources necessary for accurate model-based designs can be major bottlenecks to the widespread use of appropriate dose-finding methods in phase I practice. The theoretically- and empirically-based methods in Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method will lessen the statistician’s burden and encourage the continuing development and implementation of model-based dose-finding methods.},

  abstract = {Summary. Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics46, 33–48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2–4 years by our method.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to 9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

  abstract = {Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary “response” variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, “treatment effects,” are confounded with differences between the trials, “trial effects.” Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.},

  abstract = {Delayed dose limiting toxicities (i.e. beyond first cycle of treatment) is a challenge for phase I trials. The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is a Bayesian dose-finding design to address the issue of long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration, does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.},

  abstract = {The aims of Phase 1 trials in oncology have broadened considerably from simply demonstrating that the agent/regimen of interest is well tolerated in a relatively heterogeneous patient population to addressing multiple objectives under the heading of early-phase trials and, if possible, obtaining reliable evidence regarding clinical activity to lead to drug approvals via the Accelerated Approval approach or Breakthrough Therapy designation in cases where the tumours are rare, prognosis is poor or where there might be an unmet therapeutic need. Constructing a Phase 1 design that can address multiple objectives within the context of a single trial is not simple. Randomisation can play an important role, but carrying out such randomisation according to the principles of equipoise is a significant challenge in the Phase 1 setting. If the emerging data are not sufficient to definitively address the aims early on, then a proper design can reduce biases, enhance interpretability, and maximise information so that the Phase 1 data can be more compelling. This article outlines objectives and design considerations that need to be adhered to in order to respect ethical and scientific principles required for research in human subjects in early phase clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Sample size determination is among the most commonly encountered tasks in statistical practice. A broad range of frequentist and Bayesian methods for sample size determination can be described as choosing the smallest sample that is sufficient to achieve some set of goals. An example for the frequentist is seeking the smallest sample size that is sufficient to achieve a desired power at a specified significance level. An example for the Bayesian is seeking the smallest sample size necessary to obtain, in expectation, a desired rate of correct classification of the hypothesis as true or false. This article explores parallels between Bayesian and frequentist methods for determining sample size. We provide a simple but general and pragmatic framework for investigating the relationship between the two approaches, based on identifying mappings to connect the Bayesian and frequentist inputs necessary to obtain the same sample size. We illustrate this mapping with examples, highlighting a somewhat surprising “approximate functional correspondence” between power-based and information-based optimal sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Background In recent years, the success rate of confirmatory studies has been poor resulting in more emphasis on the conduct of exploratory studies. As one possibility to improve decision-making during the early stages of development, adaptive and Bayesian methods have been recommended. Purpose To investigate the current practice in designing early-phase studies in UK public sector research institutions and the use of adaptive and Bayesian methods in particular and to determine factors that hinder the penetration of methodological advances into practice. Methods A questionnaire was sent to all UK clinical trials units (CTUs) to gauge their involvement in early-phase studies and to learn about the designs used in these studies. Follow-up visits to units conducting early-phase studies with round-table discussions around the methods used and the obstacles faced when using adaptive methods were undertaken. Results More than half of the CTUs are involved in early-phase studies, but conservatism in the methods used in these studies is present. Reasons for novel methodology not being used include a lack of expertise, incompatible funding and unit structure, and a lack of software. Limitations Information is collected from UK CTUs, which undertake a large portion (but not all) publicly funded trials. Conclusions The use of adaptive and Bayesian methods for early-phase clinical studies in the UK public sector is at present limited. Various different initiatives aim to support and facilitate the use of these methods, however, so that an increased use of these methods can be anticipated in the future.},

  abstract = {The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95\% of phase I trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost, and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3 design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the 3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs. In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition, compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3 + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation studies with matched sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, Phase II trials have been conducted as single-arm trials to compare the response probabilities between an experimental therapy and a historical control. Historical control data, however, often have a small sample size, are collected from a different patient population, or use a different response assessment method, so that a direct comparison between a historical control and an experimental therapy may be severely biased. Randomized Phase II trials entering patients prospectively to both experimental and control arms have been proposed to avoid any bias in such cases. The small sample sizes for typical Phase II clinical trials imply that the use of exact statistical methods for their design and analysis is appropriate. In this article, we propose two-stage randomized Phase II trials based on Fisher’s exact test, which does not require specification of the response probability of the control arm for testing. Through numerical studies, we observe that the proposed method controls the type I error accurately and maintains a high power. If we specify the response probabilities of the two arms under the alternative hypothesis, we can identify good randomized Phase II trial designs by adopting the Simon’s minimax and optimal design concepts that were developed for single-arm Phase II trials.},

  abstract = {Background Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM. Methods The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to 70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for 4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers, the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to 79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in the phase IIa. Discussion Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as radiosensitizer. Trial registration NCT03212742, registered June, 7, 2017.

The process of developing and bringing new drugs to market is important for primary care physicians to understand. METHODS We describe the drug development process based on a review of the literature and Web sites addressing FDA processes and policies. RESULTS The process starts with preclinical testing. For drugs that appear safe, an investigational new drug application is filed with the FDA. If approved, clinical trials begin with phase 1 studies that focus on safety and pharmacology. Phase 2 studies examine the effectiveness of the compound. Phase 3 is the final step before submitting a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA. An NDA contains all the information obtained during all phases of testing. Phase 4 studies, or postmarketing studies, are conducted after a product is approved. Recent changes in legislation have streamlined the approval process. Critics contend that these changes have compromised public safety, resulting in the need to recall several products from the market. Proponents claim that changes in the approval process help patients with debilitating diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, that were previously denied critical medication because of bureaucratic regulations.},

To address this issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical trials.},

We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the BOIN design not only has superior finite and large sample properties but also can be easily implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional '3+3' design. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields comparable average performance to select the maximum tolerated dose but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses.

  abstract = {\#\#\#\# Abstract Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document—intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement—has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies.

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

Evaluating at doses of several drugs and their scheduling in a single Phase I trial simultaneously possess a number of statistical challenges, and specialized methods to tackle these have been proposed in the literature. However, the uptake of these methods is slow and implementation examples of such advanced methods are still sparse to date. In this work, we share our experience of proposing a model-based partial ordering continual reassessment method (POCRM) design for three-dimensional dose-finding in an oncology trial. In the trial, doses of two agents and the dosing schedule of one of them can be escalated/de-escalated. We provide a step-by-step summary on how the POCRM design was implemented and communicated to the trial team. We proposed an approach to specify toxicity orderings and their a-priori probabilities, and developed a number of visualization tools to communicate the statistical properties of the design. The design evaluation included both a comprehensive simulation study and considerations of the individual trial behavior. The study is now enrolling patients. We hope that sharing our experience of the successful implementation of an advanced design in practice that went through evaluations of several health authorities will facilitate a better uptake of more efficient methods in practice.},

Targeted therapy based on inhibiting the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancers offers the potential for a greater therapeutic window by tailoring treatment to patients with tumors lacking specific DDR functions. The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle, exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an Achilles’ heel.

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},

  abstract = {The continual reassessment method as described by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48) leans to a large extent upon a Bayesian methodology. Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples, and as far as the final recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching to the new scheme.},

Although software routines exist for conducting NMA, they require considerable statistical programming expertise to use, which limits the number of researchers able to conduct such analyses. Objectives To develop a web-based tool allowing users with only standard internet browser software to be able to conduct NMAs using an intuitive “point and click” interface and present the results using visual plots. Methods Using the existing netmeta and Shiny packages for R to conduct the analyses, and to develop the user interface, we created the MetaInsight tool which is freely available to use via the web. Results A package was created for conducting NMA which satisfied our objectives, and this is described, and its application demonstrated, using an illustrative example. Conclusions We believe that many researchers will find our package helpful for facilitating NMA as well as allowing decision makers to scrutinize presented results visually and in real time. This will impact on the relevance of statistical analyses for health care decision making and sustainably increase capacity by empowering informed nonspecialists to be able to conduct more clinically relevant reviews. It is also hoped that others will be inspired to create similar tools for other advanced specialist analyses methods using the freely available technologies we have adopted.},

  abstract = {Background/aims: Dose-escalation studies are essential in the early stages of developing novel treatments, when the aim is to find a safe dose for administration in humans. Despite their great importance, many dose-escalation studies use study designs based on heuristic algorithms with well-documented drawbacks. Bayesian decision procedures provide a design alternative that is conceptually simple and methodologically sound, but very rarely used in practice, at least in part due to their perceived statistical complexity. There are currently very few easily accessible software implementations that would facilitate their application. Methods: We have created MoDEsT, a free and easy-to-use web application for designing and conducting single-agent dose-escalation studies with a binary toxicity endpoint, where the objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose. MoDEsT uses a well-established Bayesian decision procedure based on logistic regression. The software has a user-friendly point-and-click interface, makes changes visible in real time, and automatically generates a range of graphs, tables, and reports. It is aimed at clinicians as well as statisticians with limited expertise in model-based dose-escalation designs, and does not require any statistical programming skills to evaluate the operating characteristics of, or implement, the Bayesian dose-escalation design. Results: MoDEsT comes in two parts: a ‘Design’ module to explore design options and simulate their operating characteristics, and a ‘Conduct’ module to guide the dose-finding process throughout the study. We illustrate the practical use of both modules with data from a real phase I study in terminal cancer. Conclusion: Enabling both methodologists and clinicians to understand and apply model-based study designs with ease is a key factor towards their routine use in early-phase studies. We hope that MoDEsT will enable incorporation of Bayesian decision procedures for dose escalation at the earliest stage of clinical trial design, thus increasing their use in early-phase trials.},

  abstract = {Diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews are conducted to summarize evidence on the accuracy of a diagnostic test including a critical evaluation of the primary studies. Where appropriate, the evidence is meta-analyzed to obtain pooled estimates of effectiveness.In this study, we reviewed and critiqued three DTA guidance documents with respect to the graphical presentation of DTA meta-analysis results. All three documents recommended the use of two forms of graphical presentation: (a) forest plots displaying meta-analysis results for sensitivity (ie, the true positive rate) and specificity (ie, true negative rate) separately, and (b) Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve to provide a global summary of test performance. Two primary shortcomings were identified: (a) lack of incorporation of quality assessment results into the main analysis and; (b) ambiguity with which the contribution of individual studies is represented on SROC curves. In response, two alternative graphical approaches were developed: A quality assessment enhanced SROC plot which displays the results from individual studies in the meta-analysis with multiple indicators of quality assessed using QUADAS-2; and A percentage study weights enhanced SROC plot which accurately portrays the percentage contribution each study makes to the meta-analysis. The proposed enhanced SROC curves facilitate the exploration of DTA data, leading to a deeper understanding of the primary studies included in a DTA meta-analysis including identifying reasons for between study heterogeneity and why specific study results may be divergent. Both plots can easily be produced in the free online interactive application, MetaDTA (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/dta\_ma/).},

  abstract = {Background Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. Methods We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx. Findings The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% CI 0·85–0·94, p{$<$}0·0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46). Interpretation Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, phase I dose-finding trials aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose of a new drug under the assumption that both toxicity and efficacy monotonically increase with the dose. This paradigm, however, is not suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus. For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose, defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose. We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose–efficacy relationship. We take the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is available for this specific setting. We also provide an R package dfmta that can be downloaded from CRAN website.},

  abstract = {Purpose Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice.   Methods We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs.   Results One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method.   Conclusion A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.},

  abstract = {Aims This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English radiotherapy dataset (RTDS). Materials and methods We reviewed the evidence base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009, accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population 91~500–1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages. Results The Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071 attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to 60~057. Discussion Services have increased their activity by 14\% between 2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with international evidence-based practice.},

Patient populations are more precisely defined and pose a challenge to the efficient inclusion of study patients. Objectives shift from the definition of a maximum tolerated dose to the evaluation of a recommended phase 2 dose. Other challenges related to the efficacy and safety profile of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs call for changes in designing first-in-human studies, such as definitions of biological doses, collection of fresh tumor tissue for surrogate marker analyses, and the management of infusion-related reactions with monoclonal antibodies., Consequently, the conduct of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology requires changes. Corresponding education with particular focus on phase 1 trials and on the complex drug development process needs to be an integrated part of the medical oncology curriculum for physicians and nursing staff.

  abstract = {The treatment of certain cancers has been revolutionised in recent years by the introduction of novel drugs designed to target specific molecular factors implicated in tumour growth. Notable examples include trastuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 in women with HER2-positive breast cancer; rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in KIT-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumours and sunitinib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. For regulatory reasons, new molecular targeted agents are first evaluated in advanced and metastatic disease, wherein they prolong survival. However, their most profound impact has been observed in the adjuvant setting, where they may contribute to curative therapy rather than mere palliation. Expansion in the use of molecular targeted therapies will have important cost implications for health care systems. Although expensive, on a monthly basis, molecular targeted therapies may not be more costly than treatments for other major chronic diseases, especially considering the contribution of cancer to the global disease burden, the associated socioeconomic costs and the long-term benefits of therapy. Nevertheless, the use of these agents must be optimised, in part using molecular biomarkers associated with drug response.},

  abstract = {This is the third of four articles Bayes's theorem arose from a posthumous publication in 1763 by Thomas Bayes, a non-conformist minister from Tunbridge Wells. Although it gives a simple and uncontroversial result in probability theory, specific uses of the theorem have been the subject of considerable controversy for more than two centuries. In recent years a more balanced and pragmatic perspective has emerged, and in this paper we review current thinking on the value of the Bayesian approach to health technology assessment. A concise definition of bayesian methods in health technology assessment has not been established, but we suggest the following: the explicit quantitative use of external evidence in the design, monitoring, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of a health technology assessment. This approach acknowledges that judgments about the benefits of a new technology will rarely be based solely on the results of a single study but should synthesise evidence from multiple sources—for example, pilot studies, trials of similar interventions, and even subjective judgments about the generalisability of the study's results. A bayesian perspective leads to an approach to clinical trials that is claimed to be more flexible and ethical than traditional methods,1 and to elegant ways of handling multiple substudies—for example, when simultaneously estimating the effects of a treatment on many subgroups.2 Proponents have also argued that a bayesian approach allows conclusions to be provided in a form that is most suitable for decisions specific to patients and decisions affecting public policy.3 \#\#\#\# Summary points Bayesian methods interpret data from a study in the light of external evidence and judgment, and the form in which conclusions are drawn contributes naturally to decision making Prior plausibility of hypotheses is taken into account, just as when interpreting the results of a diagnostic test Scepticism about large treatment effects can be formally …},

  abstract = {The Phase I clinical trial is a study intended to estimate the so-called maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a new drug. Although there exists more or less a standard type of design for such trials, its development has been largely ad hoc. As usually implemented, the trial design has no intrinsic property that provides a generally satisfactory basis for estimation of the MTD. In this paper, the standard design and several simple alternatives are compared with regard to the conservativeness of the design and with regard to point and interval estimation of an MTD (33rd percentile) with small sample sizes. Using a Markov chain representation, we found several designs to be nearly as conservative as the standard design in terms of the proportion of patients entered at higher dose levels. In Monte Carlo simulations, two two-stage designs are found to provide reduced bias in maximum likelihood estimation of the MTD in less than ideal dose-response settings. Of the three methods considered for determining confidence intervals-the delta method, a method based on Fieller's theorem, and a likelihood ratio method-none was able to provide both usefully narrow intervals and coverage probabilities close to nominal.},

To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papilloma virus was detectable by sequencing of DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.},

The method requires that each of the two agents has been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.},

  abstract = {Background/aims In our 2009 article, we showed that Bayesian methods had established a foothold in developing therapies in our institutional oncology trials. In this article, we will document what has happened since that time. In addition, we will describe barriers to implementing Bayesian clinical trials, as well as our experience overcoming them. Methods We reviewed MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical trials submitted to the institutional protocol office for scientific and ethical review between January 2009 and December 2013, the same length time period as the previous article. We tabulated Bayesian methods implemented for design or analyses for each trial and then compared these to our previous findings. Results Overall, we identified 1020 trials and found that 283 (28\%) had Bayesian components so we designated them as Bayesian trials. Among MD Anderson–only and multicenter trials, 56\% and 14\%, respectively, were Bayesian, higher rates than our previous study. Bayesian trials were more common in phase I/II trials (34\%) than in phase III/IV (6\%) trials. Among Bayesian trials, the most commonly used features were for toxicity monitoring (65\%), efficacy monitoring (36\%), and dose finding (22\%). The majority (86\%) of Bayesian trials used non-informative priors. A total of 75 (27\%) trials applied Bayesian methods for trial design and primary endpoint analysis. Among this latter group, the most commonly used methods were the Bayesian logistic regression model (N\,=\,22), the continual reassessment method (N\,=\,20), and adaptive randomization (N\,=\,16). Median institutional review board approval time from protocol submission was the same 1.4\,months for Bayesian and non-Bayesian trials. Since the previous publication, the Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial was the first large-scale decision trial combining multiple treatments in a single trial. Since then, two regimens in breast cancer therapy have been identified and published from the cooperative Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis (I-SPY 2), enhancing cooperation among investigators and drug developers across the nation, as well as advancing information needed for personalized medicine. Many software programs and Shiny applications for Bayesian trial design and calculations are available from our website which has had more than 21,000 downloads worldwide since 2004. Conclusion Bayesian trials have the increased flexibility in trial design needed for personalized medicine, resulting in more cooperation among researchers working to fight against cancer. Some disadvantages of Bayesian trials remain, but new methods and software are available to improve their function and incorporation into cancer clinical research.},

The impact of clinical trials not only extends to the individual patient by establishing a broader selection of effective therapies, but also to society as a whole by enhancing the value of health care provided. However, clinical trials also have the potential to pose unknown risks to their participants, and biased knowledge extracted from flawed clinical trials may lead to the inadvertent harm of patients. Although conducting a well-designed clinical trial may appear straightforward, it is founded on rigorous methodology and oversight governed by key ethical principles. In this review, we provide an overview of the ethical foundations of trial design, trial oversight, and the process of obtaining approval of a therapeutic, from its pre-clinical phase to post-marketing surveillance. This narrative review is based on a course in clinical trials developed by one of the authors (DJM), and is supplemented by a PubMed search predating January 2011 using the keywords “randomized controlled trial,” “patient/clinical research,” “ethics,” “phase IV,” “data and safety monitoring board,” and “surrogate endpoint.” With an understanding of the key principles in designing and implementing clinical trials, health care providers can partner with the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory bodies to effectively compare medical therapies and thereby meet one of the essential goals of health care reform.},

  abstract = {Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990,\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders.},

Therefore, the probability of observing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) may depend upon both the total amount of the dose given, as well as the frequency with which it is administered. The objective of the study then becomes to find an acceptable combination of both dose and schedule. Past literature on designing these trials has entailed the assumption that toxicity increases monotonically with both dose and schedule. In this article, we relax this assumption for schedules and present a dose-schedule finding design that can be generalized to situations in which we know the ordering between all schedules and those in which we do not.

Other design issues, such as working model selection and stopping rules, are also discussed.

Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%, particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising on other operating characteristics.},

Barriers to increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available.

The original design was proposed by Wages and Tait in 2015 for trials of molecularly targeted agents in cancer treatments, where dose-efficacy assumptions are not always monotonically increasing. Our goal is to improve the design’s overall performance regarding the estimation of optimal dose as well as patient allocation to effective treatments. The proposed methods calculate randomization probabilities based on the likelihood of every candidate model as opposed to the original design which selects the best model and then randomizes doses based on estimations from the selected model. Unlike the original method, our proposed adaption does not require an arbitrarily specified sample size for the adaptive randomization stage. Simulations are used to compare the proposed strategies and a final strategy is recommended. Under most scenarios, our recommended method allocates more patients to the optimal dose while improving accuracy in selecting the final optimal dose without increasing the overall risk of toxicity.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.

  abstract = {Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.},

  abstract = {A balanced treatment of the theories, methodologies, and design issues involved in clinical trials using statistical methods  There has been enormous interest and development in Bayesian adaptive designs, especially for early phases of clinical trials. However, for phase III trials, frequentist methods still play a dominant role through controlling type I and type II errors in the hypothesis testing framework. From practical perspectives, Clinical Trial Design: Bayesian and Frequentist Adaptive Methods provides comprehensive coverage of both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to all phases of clinical trial design. Before underpinning various adaptive methods, the book establishes an overview of the fundamentals of clinical trials as well as a comparison of Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Recognizing that clinical trial design is one of the most important and useful skills in the pharmaceutical industry, this book provides detailed discussions on a variety of statistical designs, their properties, and operating characteristics for phase I, II, and III clinical trials as well as an introduction to phase IV trials. Many practical issues and challenges arising in clinical trials are addressed. Additional topics of coverage include:   Risk and benefit analysis for toxicity and efficacy trade-offs   Bayesian predictive probability trial monitoring   Bayesian adaptive randomization   Late onset toxicity and response   Dose finding in drug combination trials   Targeted therapy designs   The author utilizes cutting-edge clinical trial designs and statistical methods that have been employed at the world's leading medical centers as well as in the pharmaceutical industry. The software used throughout the book is freely available on the book's related website, equipping readers with the necessary tools for designing clinical trials. Clinical Trial Design is an excellent book for courses on the topic at the graduate level. The book also serves as a valuable reference for statisticians and biostatisticians in the pharmaceutical industry as well as for researchers and practitioners who design, conduct, and monitor clinical trials in their everyday work.},

  abstract = {Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents with specific biologic targets and limited toxicity require novel designs to determine doses to be taken forward into larger studies. In this paper, we describe an approach that incorporates both toxicity and efficacy data into the estimation of the biologically optimal dose of an agent in a phase I trial. The approach is based on the flexible continuation-ratio model, and uses straightforward optimal dose selection criteria. Dose selection is based on all patients treated up until that time point, using a continual reassessment method approach. Dose–outcome curves considered include monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and unimodal curves. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed design, which we call TriCRM, has favourable operating characteristics. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {We propose a Bayesian optimal phase II (BOP2) design for clinical trials with a time-to-event endpoint (eg, progression-free survival [PFS]) or co-primary endpoints consisted of a time-to-event endpoint and a categorical endpoint (eg, PFS and toxicity). We use an exponential-inverse gamma model to model the time to event. At each interim, the go/no-go decision is made by comparing the posterior probabilities of the event of interest with an adaptive probability cutoff. The BOP2 design is flexible in the number of interim looks and applicable to both single-arm and two-arm trials. The design maximizes the power for detecting effective treatments, with a well-controlled type I error, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian designs and frequentist designs. The BOP2 design is easy to implement. Its stopping boundary can be enumerated and included in study protocol before the onset of the trial for single-arm studies. Simulation studies show that the BOP2 design has favorable operating characteristics, with higher power and lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some Bayesian phase II designs. The software to implement the BOP2 design will be freely available at www.trialdesign.org.},

  abstract = {We propose a flexible Bayesian optimal phase II (BOP2) design that is capable of handling simple (e.g., binary) and complicated (e.g., ordinal, nested, and co-primary) endpoints under a unified framework. We use a Dirichlet-multinomial model to accommodate different types of endpoints. At each interim, the go/no-go decision is made by evaluating a set of posterior probabilities of the events of interest, which is optimized to maximize power or minimize the number of patients under the null hypothesis. Unlike other existing Bayesian designs, the BOP2 design explicitly controls the type I error rate, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian designs and frequentist designs. In addition, the stopping boundary of the BOP2 design can be enumerated prior to the onset of the trial. These features make the BOP2 design accessible to a wide range of users and regulatory agencies and particularly easy to implement in practice. Simulation studies show that the BOP2 design has favorable operating characteristics with higher power and lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some existing Bayesian phase II designs.

  abstract = {In the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the objective of dose finding is often to identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), rather than the maximum tolerated dose. We develop a utility-based Bayesian optimal interval (U-BOIN) phase I/II design to find the OBD. We jointly model toxicity and efficacy using a multinomial-Dirichlet model, and employ a utility function to measure dose risk-benefit trade-off. The U-BOIN design consists of two seamless stages. In stage I, the Bayesian optimal interval design is used to quickly explore the dose space and collect preliminary toxicity and efficacy data. In stage II, we continuously update the posterior estimate of the utility for each dose after each cohort, using accumulating efficacy and toxicity from both stages I and II, and then use the posterior estimate to direct the dose assignment and selection. Compared to existing phase I/II designs, one prominent advantage of the U-BOIN design is its simplicity for implementation. Once the trial is designed, it can be easily applied using predetermined decision tables, without complex model fitting and estimation. Our simulation study shows that, despite its simplicity, the U-BOIN design is robust and has high accuracy to identify the OBD. We extend the design to accommodate delayed efficacy by leveraging the short-term endpoint (eg, immune activity or other biological activity of targeted agents), and using it to predict the delayed efficacy outcome to facilitate real-time decision making. A user-friendly software to implement the U-BOIN is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.},
