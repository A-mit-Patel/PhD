  abstract = {Summary. Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics46, 33–48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2–4 years by our method.},

  abstract = {Background
Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM.

Methods
The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to 70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for 4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers, the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to 79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in the phase IIa.

Discussion
Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as radiosensitizer.

To address this issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical trials.},

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},

  abstract = {Background
Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment.
Methods
We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx.
Findings
The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% CI 0·85–0·94, p{$<$}0·0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46).
Interpretation
Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

  abstract = {Aims
This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English radiotherapy dataset (RTDS).
Materials and methods
We reviewed the evidence base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009, accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population 91~500–1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages.
Results
The Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071 attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to 60~057.
Discussion
Services have increased their activity by 14\% between 2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with international evidence-based practice.},

In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis.

The method requires that each of the two agents has been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.},

The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990,\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders.},

Despite the emergence of novel methodology in the area, it is rare that innovative approaches are used in practice. In this article, we review three methods for Phase I combination studies that are easy to understand and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of the designs through illustration in a single trial, as well as through extensive simulation studies, with the aim of increasing the use of novel approaches in phase I combination studies. Design specifications and software capabilities are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In studies of combinations of agents in phase I oncology trials, the dose–toxicity relationship may not be monotone for all combinations, in which case the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order. The continual reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM. We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings, formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection and stopping rules, are also discussed. We demonstrate the practical ability of PO-CRM as a phase I design for combinations through its use in a recent trial designed at the University of Virginia Cancer Center.},

Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM) was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of the trial.},

  abstract = {The product of independent beta probabilities escalation (PIPE) design for dual-agent phase I dose-escalation trials is a Bayesian model-free approach for identifying multiple maximum tolerated dose combinations of novel combination therapies. Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%, particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising on other operating characteristics.},

  abstract = {Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose. Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.},
