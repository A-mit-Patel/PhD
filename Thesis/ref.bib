	abstract = {Background
Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment.
Methods
We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx.
Findings
The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10 741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% {CI} 0·85–0·94, p{\textless}0·0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46).
Interpretation
Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

	abstract = {Aims
This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy Advisory Group ({NRAG}) model, from the international literature and also with observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English radiotherapy dataset ({RTDS}).
Materials and methods
We reviewed the evidence base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009, accurate to the Primary Care Trust ({PCT}) level (population 91 500–1 282 384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages.
Results
The Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the {NRAG} and Malthus models. The latter models that 48 827 attendances should have been delivered per million population in 2011. National data from {RTDS} show 32 071 attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is predicted to grow to about 55 206 attendances per million and by 2020 to 60 057.
Discussion
Services have increased their activity by 14\% between 2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with international evidence-based practice.},

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.},
