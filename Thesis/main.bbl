    This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1
  clinical trials in cancer. The basic idea and motivation behind the approach
  stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation
  with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that
  for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little
  interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given
  targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which
  all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this
  level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical
  requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are
  that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity
  level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic
  response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at
  a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real
  promise.%

    Purpose Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine
  suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in
  that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This
  study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective
  statistical designs to clinical practice. Methods We examined abstract
  records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database
  between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials)
  and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We
  then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical
  designs. Results One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90
  statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials
  (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical
  studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication
  of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20
  clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used
  variations of the standard up-and-down method. Conclusion A consequence of
  using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses
  outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that
  up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels
  versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of
  treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies
  (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the
  adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated
  at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.%

    Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly
  targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have
  different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit
  from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities,
  late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in
  the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of
  adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles
  published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials
  were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug
  studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591
  (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to
  9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the
  trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy
  trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the
  chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of
  trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption
  of these designs continues to remain low.%

  All designs are implemented with a common interface. We also offer optional
  additional classes to tailor the behaviour of all designs, including avoiding
  skipping doses, stopping after n patients have been treated at the
  recommended dose, stopping when a toxicity condition is met, or demanding
  that n patients are treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining
  together these classes using the pipe operator from 'magrittr', it is simple
  to tailor the behaviour of a dose-finding design so it behaves how the
  trialist wants. Having provided a flexible interface for specifying designs,
  we then provide functions to run simulations and calculate dose-paths for
  future cohorts of patients.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common, morbid, and
  frequently lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed
  whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority
  exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human
  papilloma virus was detectable by sequencing of DNA from infected tumors. In
  addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN,
  PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated
  in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that
  regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating
  its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally,
  the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal
  fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.%

    Aims This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England
  from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy
  Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with
  observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English
  radiotherapy dataset (RTDS). Materials and methods We reviewed the evidence
  base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and
  international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical
  trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand
  was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009,
  accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population
  91~500‚Äì1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English
  cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of
  changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages. Results The
  Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for
  lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who
  should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is
  lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall
  estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and
  Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been
  delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071
  attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be
  required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all
  cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at
  odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is
  predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to
  60~057. Discussion Services have increased their activity by 14\% between
  2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low
  and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with
  international evidence-based practice.%

    Since the inception of this journal in 1948, the understanding of etiologic
  factors that contribute to and the treatment of head and neck cancer has
  evolved dramatically. Advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and
  chemotherapy have improved locoregional control, survival, and quality of
  life. The outcomes of these treatment modalities have shifted the focus of
  curative efforts from radical ablation to preservation and restoration of
  function. This evolution has been documented in the pages of Cancer for the
  past 6 decades. This review focuses on the evolution of treatment approaches
  for head and neck cancer and future directions while recognizing the historic
  contributions recorded within this journal.%

    Background Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of
  chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains
  uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on
  chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. Methods We updated data on all
  patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients
  with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx.
  Findings The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of
  locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard
  ratio of death of 0¬∑90 (95\% CI 0¬∑85‚Äì0¬∑94, p{$<$}0¬∑0001), corresponding
  to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of
  chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy
  gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm
  conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating
  radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0¬∑91 (0¬∑79‚Äì1¬∑06) in favour
  of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation
  trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery
  and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the
  chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1¬∑19 (0¬∑97‚Äì1¬∑46).
  Interpretation Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant
  survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy
  is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of
  chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure
  must remain investigational.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    An underlying hallmark of cancers is their genomic instability, which is
  associated with a greater propensity to accumulate DNA damage. Historical
  treatment of cancer by radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy is based on
  this principle, yet it is accompanied by significant collateral damage to
  normal tissue and unwanted side effects. Targeted therapy based on inhibiting
  the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancers offers the potential for a greater
  therapeutic window by tailoring treatment to patients with tumors lacking
  specific DDR functions. The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly
  (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1
  or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle,
  exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an
  Achilles‚Äô heel. This review highlights the different concepts behind
  targeting DDR in cancer and how this can provide significant opportunities
  for DDR-based therapies in the future.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The overwhelming majority of dose-escalation clinical trials use methods
  that seek a maximum tolerable dose, including rule-based methods like the
  3+3, and model-based methods like CRM and EWOC. These methods assume that the
  incidences of efficacy and toxicity always increase as dose is increased.
  This assumption is widely accepted with cytotoxic therapies. In recent
  decades, however, the search for novel cancer treatments has broadened,
  increasingly focusing on inhibitors and antibodies. The rationale that higher
  doses are always associated with superior efficacy is less clear for these
  types of therapies.%

    Summary. Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each
  patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the
  next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating
  late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents,
  this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new
  method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM),
  that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension
  of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990,
  Biometrics46, 33‚Äì48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can
  be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We
  prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the
  correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's
  accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much
  shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by
  the CRM could be reduced to 2‚Äì4 years by our method.%

    Summary. We propose an adaptive two-stage Bayesian design for finding one
  or more acceptable dose combinations of two cytotoxic agents used together in
  a Phase I clinical trial. The method requires that each of the two agents has
  been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the
  case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of
  toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters
  characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either
  elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical
  data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent
  interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is
  described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and
  cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming
  commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the
  primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of
  each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent
  trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian
  adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to
  account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To
  search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the
  posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By
  reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we
  adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose.
  Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by
  comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of
  combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive
  simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and
  illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.%

    Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of
  phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single
  cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally
  tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable
  level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity
  of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent
  trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be
  expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of
  patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because
  the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for
  several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the
  orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a
  partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional
  dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the
  continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and
  Fisher (1990,\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully
  known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic
  dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a
  CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for
  partial orders.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was proposed to
  handle the problem of long trial duration in Phase\,1 trials as a result of
  late-onset toxicities. Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials
  of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the
  dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity
  probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of
  treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known
  at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM)
  was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to
  the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in
  terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of
  the trial.%

    A major practical impediment when implementing adaptive dose-finding
  designs is that the toxicity outcome used by the decision rules may not be
  observed shortly after the initiation of the treatment. To address this
  issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method
  (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as
  missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense
  that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data
  augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model
  parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate
  the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also
  compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed
  design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities
  and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more
  safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher
  probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical
  trials.%

    The product of independent beta probabilities escalation (PIPE) design for
  dual-agent phase I dose-escalation trials is a Bayesian model-free approach
  for identifying multiple maximum tolerated dose combinations of novel
  combination therapies. Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design
  has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials
  require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make
  dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced
  therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to
  late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE
  design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose
  escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and
  sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%,
  particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising
  on other operating characteristics.%

    In studies of combinations of agents in phase I oncology trials, the
  dose‚Äìtoxicity relationship may not be monotone for all combinations, in
  which case the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order. The continual
  reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I
  trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders
  associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical
  design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM.
  We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings,
  formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of
  combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection
  and stopping rules, are also discussed. We demonstrate the practical ability
  of PO-CRM as a phase I design for combinations through its use in a recent
  trial designed at the University of Virginia Cancer Center.%

    Phase I trials evaluating the safety of multi-drug combinations are

  increasing the use of novel approaches in phase I combination studies. Design

    Background Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery,
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM
  is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high
  local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new
  radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data
  showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be
  considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is
  to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the
  Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated
  radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM.
  Methods The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa
  trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to
  70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine
  the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with
  TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for
  4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined
  with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month
  overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately
  considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the
  neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers,
  the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications
  onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
  parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary
  objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy
  tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate
  tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to
  79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in
  the phase IIa. Discussion Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while
  sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the
  replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression
  in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will
  help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as
  radiosensitizer. Trial registration NCT03212742, registered June, 7, 2017.

    Delayed dose limiting toxicities (i.e. beyond first cycle of treatment) is
  a challenge for phase I trials. The time-to-event continual reassessment
  method (TITE-CRM) is a Bayesian dose-finding design to address the issue of
  long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial
  likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown
  time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid
  dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT
  evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight
  function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with
  parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the
  time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and
  maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case
  study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is
  presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and
  statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating
  characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design
  with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration,
  does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the
  existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The continual reassessment method as described by O'Quigley, Pepe, and
  Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48) leans to a large extent upon a Bayesian
  methodology. Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out
  in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we
  argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning
  upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment
  method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same
  unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples, and as far as the final
  recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not
  much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for
  in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences
  and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood
  one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the
  likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially
  then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard
  continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching
  to the new scheme.%

    Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by
  pseudo-random sampling. A key strength of simulation studies is the ability
  to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some ‚Äútruth‚Äù
  (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of
  generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such
  as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed,
  analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using
  simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis,
  reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a
  structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which
  involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and
  performance measures (‚ÄúADEMP‚Äù); coherent terminology for simulation
  studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key
  performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular
  and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With
  a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from
  Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation
  study and identify areas for improvement.%

    Phase I cancer clinical trials are small dose-finding studies designed to
  rapidly identify the optimal dose of a new anticancer agent. The optimal dose
  has been defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for conventional
  cytotoxic anticancer drugs, and this dose is typically recommended as the
  phase II dose. In the past two decades, a new approach for cancer treatment
  has emerged. This approach, now widely referred to as molecularly targeted
  therapy is designed a priori, based on the knowledge of various physiological
  molecules that have been obtained by the development of molecular biology.
  Most molecularly targeted agents slow or stop the growth of tumors. Such
  agents are, in general, less toxic than conventional cytotoxic agents; as a
  result, the maximum therapeutic effect may occur at doses well below the MTD.
  With the emergence of a growing number of molecularly targeted agents,
  approaches to early drug development are changing. We present dose-finding
  designs for phase I clinical trials of molecularly targeted drugs. There is
  an increasing need to develop designs to find the optimal biological dose
  (OBD) for molecularly targeted agents, and the utility of designs needs to be
  prospectively evaluated in future clinical dose-finding trials for a variety
  of molecularly targeted agents.%

    Traditional phase I studies find the therapeutic dose of an investigational
  drug based solely on toxicity and without regard to the drug's efficacy. We
  propose extending the continual reassessment method (CRM) to a bivariate
  trial design in which the maximum tolerated dose is based jointly on both
  toxicity and disease progression. We call our study design bCRM, for
  bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to
  find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune
  suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate
  through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and
  compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to
  designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some
  direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and
  distributions to use with a bivariate study design.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We present an adaptive Bayesian method for dose-finding in phase I/II
  clinical trials based on trade-offs between the probabilities of treatment
  efficacy and toxicity. The method accommodates either trinary or bivariate
  binary outcomes, as well as efficacy probabilities that possibly are
  nonmonotone in dose. Doses are selected for successive patient cohorts based
  on a set of efficacy-toxicity trade-off contours that partition the
  two-dimensional outcome probability domain. Priors are established by solving
  for hyperparameters that optimize the fit of the model to elicited mean
  outcome probabilities. For trinary outcomes, the new algorithm is compared to
  the method of Thall and Russell (1998, Biometrics 54, 251-264) by application
  to a trial of rapid treatment for ischemic stroke. The bivariate binary
  outcome case is illustrated by a trial of graft-versus-host disease treatment
  in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Computer simulations show that,
  under a wide rage of dose-outcome scenarios, the new method has high
  probabilities of making correct decisions and treats most patients at doses
  with desirable efficacy-toxicity trade-offs.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the objective of dose
  finding is often to identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), rather than
  the maximum tolerated dose. We develop a utility-based Bayesian optimal
  interval (U-BOIN) phase I/II design to find the OBD. We jointly model
  toxicity and efficacy using a multinomial-Dirichlet model, and employ a
  utility function to measure dose risk-benefit trade-off. The U-BOIN design
  consists of two seamless stages. In stage I, the Bayesian optimal interval
  design is used to quickly explore the dose space and collect preliminary
  toxicity and efficacy data. In stage II, we continuously update the posterior
  estimate of the utility for each dose after each cohort, using accumulating
  efficacy and toxicity from both stages I and II, and then use the posterior
  estimate to direct the dose assignment and selection. Compared to existing
  phase I/II designs, one prominent advantage of the U-BOIN design is its
  simplicity for implementation. Once the trial is designed, it can be easily
  applied using predetermined decision tables, without complex model fitting
  and estimation. Our simulation study shows that, despite its simplicity, the
  U-BOIN design is robust and has high accuracy to identify the OBD. We extend
  the design to accommodate delayed efficacy by leveraging the short-term
  endpoint (eg, immune activity or other biological activity of targeted
  agents), and using it to predict the delayed efficacy outcome to facilitate
  real-time decision making. A user-friendly software to implement the U-BOIN
  is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.%

    Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents
  with specific biologic targets and limited toxicity require novel designs to
  determine doses to be taken forward into larger studies. In this paper, we
  describe an approach that incorporates both toxicity and efficacy data into
  the estimation of the biologically optimal dose of an agent in a phase I
  trial. The approach is based on the flexible continuation-ratio model, and
  uses straightforward optimal dose selection criteria. Dose selection is based
  on all patients treated up until that time point, using a continual
  reassessment method approach. Dose‚Äìoutcome curves considered include
  monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and unimodal curves. Our
  simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed design, which we call
  TriCRM, has favourable operating characteristics. Copyright ¬© 2005 John

    With the emergence of immunotherapy and other novel therapies, the
  traditional assumption that the efficacy of the study drug increases
  monotonically with dose levels is not always true. Therefore, dose-finding
  methods evaluating only toxicity data may not be adequate. In this paper, we
  have first compared the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) and
  Toxicity Equivalence Range (TEQR) dose-finding oncology designs for safety
  with identical stopping rules; we have then extended both designs to include
  efficacy in addition to safety ‚Äì we determine the optimal dose for safety
  and efficacy using these designs by applying isotonic regression to the
  observed toxicity and efficacy rates, once the early phase trial is
  completed. We consider multiple types of underlying dose response curves,
  i.e., monotonically increasing, plateau, or umbrella-shaped. We conduct
  simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the two
  proposed designs and compare them to existing designs. We found that the
  extended mTPI design selects the optimal dose for safety and efficacy more
  accurately than the other designs for most of the scenarios considered.%

    The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I
  dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95\% of phase I
  trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and
  its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can
  conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost,
  and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board
  and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3
  design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation
  studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical
  literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying
  true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the
  3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs.
  In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample
  sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing
  patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability
  interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition,
  compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher
  probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is
  matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to
  implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we
  highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3
  + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct
  comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation
  studies with matched sample sizes.%

    Purpose This paper introduces the target equivalence range (TEQR) design, a
  frequentist implementation of the modified toxicity probability interval
  (mTPI) design, as a competitor to the standard 3+3 design (3+3). The 3+3 is
  the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose
  exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of
  toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Its main competitor, the
  continual reassessment method (CRM) has not found a true niche in the Phase I
  armamentarium resulting from statistical and implementation complexities.
  Methods We describe the four competing designs (3+3, mTPI, CRM, and TEQR),
  comparing them based on i) operating characteristics from simulated trials,
  and ii) ease of implementation. Results The TEQR is better than the 3+3 when
  compared on; 1) number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity
  level was selected as the MTD, 2) number of patients assigned to dose levels
  at or nearest the MTD, 3) overall trial dose limiting toxicity rate and 4)
  accuracy and precision of estimates for the rate of toxicity at the MTD.
  Further it is reasonably comparable to the CRM and mTPI on 1‚Äì3. Conclusion
  The TEQR offers trial designers a competitor to the 3+3 for ease of
  implementation with better operating characteristics and the added attraction
  of a glimpse of activity at the MTD. The R package TEQR, freely available
  from the comprehensive R archive network, includes functions to calculate
  dose escalation guidelines and operating characteristics.%

    Conventionally, phase I dose-finding trials aim to determine the maximum
  tolerated dose of a new drug under the assumption that both toxicity and
  efficacy monotonically increase with the dose. This paradigm, however, is not
  suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies,
  for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus.
  For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose,
  defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We
  develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose.
  We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the
  increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose‚Äìefficacy relationship. We take
  the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy
  is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the
  posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively
  assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the
  proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to
  be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is
  available for this specific setting. We also provide an R package dfmta that
  can be downloaded from CRAN website.%

    In dose-finding trials of chemotherapeutic agents, the goal of identifying
  the maximum tolerated dose is usually determined by considering information
  on toxicity only, with the assumption that the highest safe dose also
  provides the most promising outlook for efficacy. Trials of molecularly
  targeted agents challenge accepted dose-finding methods because minimal
  toxicity may arise over all doses under consideration and higher doses may
  not result in greater response. In this article, we propose a new early-phase
  method for trials investigating targeted agents. We provide simulation
  results illustrating the operating characteristics of our design.%

    In this article, we propose and evaluate three alternative randomization
  strategies to the adaptive randomization (AR) stage used in a seamless Phase
  I/II dose-finding design. The original design was proposed by Wages and Tait
  in 2015 for trials of molecularly targeted agents in cancer treatments, where
  dose-efficacy assumptions are not always monotonically increasing. Our goal
  is to improve the design‚Äôs overall performance regarding the estimation of
  optimal dose as well as patient allocation to effective treatments. The
  proposed methods calculate randomization probabilities based on the
  likelihood of every candidate model as opposed to the original design which
  selects the best model and then randomizes doses based on estimations from
  the selected model. Unlike the original method, our proposed adaption does
  not require an arbitrarily specified sample size for the adaptive
  randomization stage. Simulations are used to compare the proposed strategies
  and a final strategy is recommended. Under most scenarios, our recommended
  method allocates more patients to the optimal dose while improving accuracy
  in selecting the final optimal dose without increasing the overall risk of
  toxicity.%

    The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates
  efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity.
  Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs
  in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional
  rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains
  limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP),
  which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic
  challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in
  advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients
  (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated
  information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties,
  we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's
  specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In
  particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should
  be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement
  a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid
  leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown,
  complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each
  dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for
  each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design
  and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored
  model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the
  co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs
  by statisticians and investigators. Clin Cancer Res; 23(24); 7440‚Äì7. ¬©2017

    \field{abstract}{%
    The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a model-based design for phase I
  trials, which aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new therapy.
  The CRM has been shown to be more accurate in targeting the MTD than
  traditional rule-based approaches such as the 3\,+\,3 design, which is used
  in most phase I trials. Furthermore, the CRM has been shown to assign more
  trial participants at or close to the MTD than the 3\,+\,3 design. However,
  the CRM‚Äôs uptake in clinical research has been incredibly slow, putting
  trial participants, drug development and patients at risk. Barriers to
  increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of
  knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in
  practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians
  on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available. Furthermore,
  practical resources to support clinicians considering the CRM for their
  trials are scarce.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    As clinicians begin to realize the important role of dose-finding in the
  drug development process, there is an increasing openness to "novel" methods
  proposed in the past two decades. In particular, the Continual Reassessment
  Method (CRM) and its variations have drawn much attention in the medical
  community, though it has yet to become a commonplace tool. To overcome the
  status quo in phase I clinical trials, statisticians must be able to design
  trials using the CRM in a timely and reproducible manner. A self-contained
  theoretical framework of the CRM for researchers and graduate students who
  set out to learn and do research in the CRM and dose-finding methods in
  general, Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method features: Real
  clinical trial examples that illustrate the methods and techniques throughout
  the book Detailed calibration techniques that enable biostatisticians to
  design a CRM in timely manner Limitations of the CRM are outlined to aid in
  correct use of method This book supplies practical, efficient dose-finding
  methods based on cutting edge statistical research. More than just a
  cookbook, it provides full, unified coverage of the CRM in addition to
  step-by-step guidelines to automation and parameterization of the methods
  used on a regular basis. A detailed exposition of the calibration of the CRM
  for applied statisticians working with dose-finding in phase I trials, the
  book focuses on the R package ‚Äòdfcrm‚Äô for the CRM and its major variants.
  The author recognizes clinicians‚Äô skepticism of model-based designs, and
  addresses their concerns that the time, professional, and computational
  resources necessary for accurate model-based designs can be major bottlenecks
  to the widespread use of appropriate dose-finding methods in phase I
  practice. The theoretically- and empirically-based methods in Dose Finding by
  the Continual Reassessment Method will lessen the statistician‚Äôs burden and
  encourage the continuing development and implementation of model-based
  dose-finding methods.%

    There are two competing philosophies of statistical analysis: the Bayesian
  and the frequentist. The frequentists are much the larger group, and almost
  all the statistical analyses which appear in the BMJ are frequentist. The
  Bayesians are much fewer and until recently could only snipe at the
  frequentists from the high ground of university departments of mathematical
  statistics. Now the increasing power of computers is bringing Bayesian
  methods to thefore. Bayesian methods are based on the idea that unknown
  quantities, such as population means and proportions, have
  probabilitydistributions. The probability distribution for a population
  proportionexpresses our prior knowledge or belief about it, before we add the
  knowledge which comes from our data. For example, suppose we want to estimate
  the prevalence of diabetes in a health district. We could use the knowledge
  that the percentage of diabetics in the United Kingdom as a whole is about
  2\%, so we expect the prevalence in our health district to be fairly similar.
  It is unlikely to be 10\%, for example. We might ‚Ä¶%

    This is the third of four articles Bayes's theorem arose from a posthumous
  publication in 1763 by Thomas Bayes, a non-conformist minister from Tunbridge
  Wells. Although it gives a simple and uncontroversial result in probability
  theory, specific uses of the theorem have been the subject of considerable
  controversy for more than two centuries. In recent years a more balanced and
  pragmatic perspective has emerged, and in this paper we review current
  thinking on the value of the Bayesian approach to health technology
  assessment. A concise definition of bayesian methods in health technology
  assessment has not been established, but we suggest the following: the
  explicit quantitative use of external evidence in the design, monitoring,
  analysis, interpretation, and reporting of a health technology assessment.
  This approach acknowledges that judgments about the benefits of a new
  technology will rarely be based solely on the results of a single study but
  should synthesise evidence from multiple sources‚Äîfor example, pilot
  studies, trials of similar interventions, and even subjective judgments about
  the generalisability of the study's results. A bayesian perspective leads to
  an approach to clinical trials that is claimed to be more flexible and
  ethical than traditional methods,1 and to elegant ways of handling multiple
  substudies‚Äîfor example, when simultaneously estimating the effects of a
  treatment on many subgroups.2 Proponents have also argued that a bayesian
  approach allows conclusions to be provided in a form that is most suitable
  for decisions specific to patients and decisions affecting public policy.3
  \#\#\#\# Summary points Bayesian methods interpret data from a study in the
  light of external evidence and judgment, and the form in which conclusions
  are drawn contributes naturally to decision making Prior plausibility of
  hypotheses is taken into account, just as when interpreting the results of a

    This highly acclaimed text, now available in paperback, provides a thorough
  account of key concepts and theoretical results, with particular emphasis on
  viewing statistical inference as a special case of decision theory.
  Information-theoretic concepts play a central role in the development of the
  theory, which provides, in particular, a detailed discussion of the problem
  of specification of so-called prior ignorance . The work is written from the
  authors s committed Bayesian perspective, but an overview of non-Bayesian
  theories is also provided, and each chapter contains a wide-ranging critical
  re-examination of controversial issues. The level of mathematics used is such
  that most material is accessible to readers with knowledge of advanced
  calculus. In particular, no knowledge of abstract measure theory is assumed,
  and the emphasis throughout is on statistical concepts rather than rigorous
  mathematics. The book will be an ideal source for all students and
  researchers in statistics, mathematics, decision analysis, economic and
  business studies, and all branches of science and engineering, who wish to
  further their understanding of Bayesian statistics%

    A simple closed-form approximation for the median of the beta distribution
  Beta(a, b) is introduced: (a-1/3)/(a+b-2/3) for (a,b) both larger than 1 has
  a relative error of less than 4\%, rapidly decreasing to zero as both shape
  parameters increase.%
