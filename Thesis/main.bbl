    \field{abstract}{%
    Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common, morbid, and
  frequently lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed
  whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority
  exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human
  papilloma virus was detectable by sequencing of DNA from infected tumors. In
  addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN,
  PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated
  in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that
  regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating
  its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally,
  the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal
  fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.%

    Aims This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England
  from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy
  Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with
  observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English
  radiotherapy dataset (RTDS). Materials and methods We reviewed the evidence
  base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and
  international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical
  trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand
  was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009,
  accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population
  91~500–1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English
  cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of
  changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages. Results The
  Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for
  lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who
  should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is
  lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall
  estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and
  Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been
  delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071
  attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be
  required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all
  cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at
  odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is
  predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to
  60~057. Discussion Services have increased their activity by 14\% between
  2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low
  and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with
  international evidence-based practice.%

    Since the inception of this journal in 1948, the understanding of etiologic
  factors that contribute to and the treatment of head and neck cancer has
  evolved dramatically. Advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and
  chemotherapy have improved locoregional control, survival, and quality of
  life. The outcomes of these treatment modalities have shifted the focus of
  curative efforts from radical ablation to preservation and restoration of
  function. This evolution has been documented in the pages of Cancer for the
  past 6 decades. This review focuses on the evolution of treatment approaches
  for head and neck cancer and future directions while recognizing the historic
  contributions recorded within this journal.%

    Background Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of
  chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains
  uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on
  chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. Methods We updated data on all
  patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients
  with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx.
  Findings The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of
  locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard
  ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% CI 0·85–0·94, p{$<$}0·0001), corresponding
  to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of
  chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy
  gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm
  conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating
  radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour
  of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation
  trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery
  and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the
  chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46).
  Interpretation Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant
  survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy
  is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of
  chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure
  must remain investigational.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    An underlying hallmark of cancers is their genomic instability, which is
  associated with a greater propensity to accumulate DNA damage. Historical
  treatment of cancer by radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy is based on
  this principle, yet it is accompanied by significant collateral damage to
  normal tissue and unwanted side effects. Targeted therapy based on inhibiting
  the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancers offers the potential for a greater
  therapeutic window by tailoring treatment to patients with tumors lacking
  specific DDR functions. The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly
  (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1
  or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle,
  exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an
  Achilles’ heel. This review highlights the different concepts behind
  targeting DDR in cancer and how this can provide significant opportunities
  for DDR-based therapies in the future.%

    This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1
  clinical trials in cancer. The basic idea and motivation behind the approach
  stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation
  with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that
  for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little
  interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given
  targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which
  all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this
  level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical
  requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are
  that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity
  level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic
  response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at
  a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real
  promise.%

    Purpose Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine
  suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in
  that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This
  study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective
  statistical designs to clinical practice. Methods We examined abstract
  records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database
  between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials)
  and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We
  then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical
  designs. Results One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90
  statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials
  (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical
  studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication
  of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20
  clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used
  variations of the standard up-and-down method. Conclusion A consequence of
  using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses
  outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that
  up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels
  versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of
  treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies
  (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the
  adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated
  at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.%

    Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly
  targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have
  different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit
  from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities,
  late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in
  the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of
  adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles
  published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials
  were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug
  studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591
  (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to
  9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the
  trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy
  trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the
  chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of
  trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption
  of these designs continues to remain low.%

    {$<$}p{$>$}The overwhelming majority of dose-escalation clinical trials use
  methods that seek a maximum tolerable dose, including rule-based methods like
  the 3+3, and model-based methods like CRM and EWOC. These methods assume that
  the incidences of efficacy and toxicity always increase as dose is increased.
  This assumption is widely accepted with cytotoxic therapies. In recent
  decades, however, the search for novel cancer treatments has broadened,
  increasingly focusing on inhibitors and antibodies. The rationale that higher
  doses are always associated with superior efficacy is less clear for these
  types of therapies. We extracted dose-level efficacy and toxicity outcomes
  from 115 manuscripts reporting dose-finding clinical trials in cancer between
  2008 and 2014. We analysed the outcomes from each manuscript using flexible
  non-linear regression models to investigate the evidence supporting the
  monotonic efficacy and toxicity assumptions. We found that the monotonic
  toxicity assumption was well-supported across most treatment classes and
  disease areas. In contrast, we found very little evidence supporting the
  monotonic efficacy assumption. Our conclusion is that dose-escalation trials
  routinely use methods whose assumptions are violated by the outcomes
  observed. As a consequence, dose-finding trials risk recommending
  unjustifiably high doses that are harmful to patients. We recommend that
  trialists consider experimental designs that allow toxicity and efficacy
  outcomes to jointly determine the doses given to patients and recommended for
  further study.{$<$}/p{$>$}%

    Summary. Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each
  patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the
  next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating
  late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents,
  this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new
  method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM),
  that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension
  of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990,
  Biometrics46, 33–48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can
  be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We
  prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the
  correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's
  accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much
  shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by
  the CRM could be reduced to 2–4 years by our method.%

    Summary. We propose an adaptive two-stage Bayesian design for finding one
  or more acceptable dose combinations of two cytotoxic agents used together in
  a Phase I clinical trial. The method requires that each of the two agents has
  been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the
  case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of
  toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters
  characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either
  elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical
  data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent
  interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is
  described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and
  cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.%

    Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming
  commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the
  primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of
  each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent
  trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian
  adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to
  account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To
  search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the
  posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By
  reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we
  adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose.
  Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by
  comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of
  combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive
  simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and
  illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of
  phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single
  cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally
  tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable
  level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity
  of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent
  trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be
  expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of
  patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because
  the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for
  several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the
  orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a
  partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional
  dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the
  continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and
  Fisher (1990,\hspace{0.6em}Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully
  known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic
  dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a
  CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for
  partial orders.%

    The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was proposed to
  handle the problem of long trial duration in Phase\,1 trials as a result of
  late-onset toxicities. Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials
  of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the
  dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity
  probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of
  treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known
  at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM)
  was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to
  the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in
  terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of
  the trial.%

    A major practical impediment when implementing adaptive dose-finding
  designs is that the toxicity outcome used by the decision rules may not be
  observed shortly after the initiation of the treatment. To address this
  issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method
  (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as
  missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense
  that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data
  augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model
  parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate
  the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also
  compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed
  design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities
  and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more
  safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher
  probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical
  trials.%

    The product of independent beta probabilities escalation (PIPE) design for
  dual-agent phase I dose-escalation trials is a Bayesian model-free approach
  for identifying multiple maximum tolerated dose combinations of novel
  combination therapies. Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design
  has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials
  require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make
  dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced
  therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to
  late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE
  design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose
  escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and
  sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%,
  particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising
  on other operating characteristics.%

    In studies of combinations of agents in phase I oncology trials, the
  dose–toxicity relationship may not be monotone for all combinations, in
  which case the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order. The continual
  reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I
  trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders
  associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical
  design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM.
  We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings,
  formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of
  combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection
  and stopping rules, are also discussed. We demonstrate the practical ability
  of PO-CRM as a phase I design for combinations through its use in a recent
  trial designed at the University of Virginia Cancer Center.%

    Phase I trials evaluating the safety of multi-drug combinations are

  in the area, it is rare that innovative approaches are used in practice. In
  this article, we review three methods for Phase I combination studies that

  increasing the use of novel approaches in phase I combination studies. Design

    Background Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery,
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM
  is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high
  local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new
  radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data
  showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be
  considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is
  to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the
  Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated
  radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM.
  Methods The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa
  trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to
  70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine
  the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with
  TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for
  4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined
  with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month
  overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately
  considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the
  neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers,
  the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications
  onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
  parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary
  objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy
  tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate
  tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to
  79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in
  the phase IIa. Discussion Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while
  sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the
  replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression
  in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will
  help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as
  radiosensitizer. Trial registration NCT03212742, registered June, 7, 2017.

  long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial
  likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown
  time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid
  dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT
  evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight
  function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with
  parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the
  time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and
  maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case
  study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is
  presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and
  statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating
  characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design
  with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration,
  does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the
  existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.%
