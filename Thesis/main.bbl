    Clinical trials are time consuming, expensive, and often burdensome on
  patients. Clinical trials can fail for many reasons. This survey reviews many
  of these reasons and offers insights on opportunities for improving the
  likelihood of creating and executing successful clinical trials. Literature
  from the past 30 years was reviewed for relevant data. Common patterns in
  reported successful trials are identified, including factors regarding the
  study site, study coordinator/investigator, and the effects on participating
  patients. Specific instances where artificial intelligence can help improve
  clinical trials are identified.%

    BACKGROUND Each year many new prescription drugs are approved by the Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA). The process of developing and bringing new
  drugs to market is important for primary care physicians to understand.
  METHODS We describe the drug development process based on a review of the
  literature and Web sites addressing FDA processes and policies. RESULTS The
  process starts with preclinical testing. For drugs that appear safe, an
  investigational new drug application is filed with the FDA. If approved,
  clinical trials begin with phase 1 studies that focus on safety and
  pharmacology. Phase 2 studies examine the effectiveness of the compound.
  Phase 3 is the final step before submitting a new drug application (NDA) to
  the FDA. An NDA contains all the information obtained during all phases of
  testing. Phase 4 studies, or postmarketing studies, are conducted after a
  product is approved. Recent changes in legislation have streamlined the
  approval process. Critics contend that these changes have compromised public
  safety, resulting in the need to recall several products from the market.
  Proponents claim that changes in the approval process help patients with
  debilitating diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, that were
  previously denied critical medication because of bureaucratic regulations.%

    This article provides a brief overview of the processes of drug discovery
  and development. Our aim is to help scientists whose research may be relevant
  to drug discovery and/or development to frame their research report in a way
  that appropriately places their findings within the drug discovery and
  development process and thereby support effective translation of preclinical
  research to humans. One overall theme of our article is that the process is
  sufficiently long, complex, and expensive so that many biological targets
  must be considered for every new medicine eventually approved for clinical
  use and new research tools may be needed to investigate each new target.
  Studies that contribute to solving any of the many scientific and operational
  issues involved in the development process can improve the efficiency of the
  process. An awareness of these issues allows the early implementation of
  measures to increase the opportunity for success. As editors of the journal,
  we encourage submission of research reports that provide data relevant to the
  issues presented.%

    This chapter describes the different phases in Clinical Research. It
  explains how these phases follow on from preclinical trials done in
  laboratories and in animals. A series of clinical trials with increasing
  number of subjects must be conducted before a new product can be introduced
  onto the market. Clinical trials involving new drugs are conducted in a
  series of sequential steps, called phases to determine the safety and
  tolerability of the new drug and the efficacy against the target disease(s).
  Each phase is designed to answer a separate research question and is a
  separate clinical trial. The drug-development process is conducted over all
  of these phases and can take many years. Clinical trials are generally
  classified into Phases I to IV.%

    The aims of Phase 1 trials in oncology have broadened considerably from
  simply demonstrating that the agent/regimen of interest is well tolerated in
  a relatively heterogeneous patient population to addressing multiple
  objectives under the heading of early-phase trials and, if possible,
  obtaining reliable evidence regarding clinical activity to lead to drug
  approvals via the Accelerated Approval approach or Breakthrough Therapy
  designation in cases where the tumours are rare, prognosis is poor or where
  there might be an unmet therapeutic need. Constructing a Phase 1 design that
  can address multiple objectives within the context of a single trial is not
  simple. Randomisation can play an important role, but carrying out such
  randomisation according to the principles of equipoise is a significant
  challenge in the Phase 1 setting. If the emerging data are not sufficient to
  definitively address the aims early on, then a proper design can reduce
  biases, enhance interpretability, and maximise information so that the Phase
  1 data can be more compelling. This article outlines objectives and design
  considerations that need to be adhered to in order to respect ethical and
  scientific principles required for research in human subjects in early phase
  clinical trials.%

    Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments,
  with outcome characterized by one binary “response” variable. Clinical
  investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend
  that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the
  comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When
  different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual
  differences between response rates associated with the treatments,
  “treatment effects,” are confounded with differences between the trials,
  “trial effects.” Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect
  separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of
  different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be
  due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect
  may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial
  effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus
  fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate
  in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both
  adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important
  information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and
  unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials
  and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is
  critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns
  motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection
  trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three
  illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.%

    The classic single-arm oncology phase II trial designs for evaluating an
  experimental regimen/agent are limited by multiple sources of bias arising
  from the inability to separate trial effects (such as patient selection,
  trial eligibility, imaging techniques and assessment schedule, and treatment
  locations) from treatment effect on clinical outcomes. Changes in patient
  population based on biologic subsetting, newer imaging technologies, the use
  of alternative end points, constrained resources, and the multitude of
  promising therapies for a given disease make randomized phase II designs,
  with a concurrent control arm where necessary, attractive. In this brief
  report, we discuss the salient features of the randomized designs for phase
  II trials, which when properly applied under the constraints of their
  underlying inference framework can assure optimal use of limited phase III
  financial and patient resources.%

    The recent focus of federal funding on comparative effectiveness research
  underscores the importance of clinical trials in the practice of
  evidence-based medicine and health care reform. The impact of clinical trials
  not only extends to the individual patient by establishing a broader
  selection of effective therapies, but also to society as a whole by enhancing
  the value of health care provided. However, clinical trials also have the
  potential to pose unknown risks to their participants, and biased knowledge
  extracted from flawed clinical trials may lead to the inadvertent harm of
  patients. Although conducting a well-designed clinical trial may appear
  straightforward, it is founded on rigorous methodology and oversight governed
  by key ethical principles. In this review, we provide an overview of the
  ethical foundations of trial design, trial oversight, and the process of
  obtaining approval of a therapeutic, from its pre-clinical phase to
  post-marketing surveillance. This narrative review is based on a course in
  clinical trials developed by one of the authors (DJM), and is supplemented by
  a PubMed search predating January 2011 using the keywords “randomized
  controlled trial,” “patient/clinical research,” “ethics,” “phase
  IV,” “data and safety monitoring board,” and “surrogate endpoint.”
  With an understanding of the key principles in designing and implementing
  clinical trials, health care providers can partner with the pharmaceutical
  industry and regulatory bodies to effectively compare medical therapies and
  thereby meet one of the essential goals of health care reform.%

    Phase 1 first-in-human studies with anti-cancer products differ from other
  phase 1 studies in that they are evaluated in patients rather than healthy
  volunteers. The rationale design of targeted drugs triggers changes in the
  design of these studies. Patient populations are more precisely defined and
  pose a challenge to the efficient inclusion of study patients. Objectives
  shift from the definition of a maximum tolerated dose to the evaluation of a
  recommended phase 2 dose. Other challenges related to the efficacy and safety
  profile of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs call for changes in designing
  first-in-human studies, such as definitions of biological doses, collection
  of fresh tumor tissue for surrogate marker analyses, and the management of
  infusion-related reactions with monoclonal antibodies., Consequently, the
  conduct of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology requires changes.
  Corresponding education with particular focus on phase 1 trials and on the
  complex drug development process needs to be an integrated part of the
  medical oncology curriculum for physicians and nursing staff. This is a
  crucial element for institutions to remain or become clinical research sites
  for phase 1 studies, and to participate in the drug development process of
  novel anti-cancer compounds in the future.%

    The Phase I clinical trial is a study intended to estimate the so-called
  maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a new drug. Although there exists more or
  less a standard type of design for such trials, its development has been
  largely ad hoc. As usually implemented, the trial design has no intrinsic
  property that provides a generally satisfactory basis for estimation of the
  MTD. In this paper, the standard design and several simple alternatives are
  compared with regard to the conservativeness of the design and with regard to
  point and interval estimation of an MTD (33rd percentile) with small sample
  sizes. Using a Markov chain representation, we found several designs to be
  nearly as conservative as the standard design in terms of the proportion of
  patients entered at higher dose levels. In Monte Carlo simulations, two
  two-stage designs are found to provide reduced bias in maximum likelihood
  estimation of the MTD in less than ideal dose-response settings. Of the three
  methods considered for determining confidence intervals-the delta method, a
  method based on Fieller's theorem, and a likelihood ratio method-none was
  able to provide both usefully narrow intervals and coverage probabilities
  close to nominal.%

    Background An extensive literature has covered the statistical properties
  of the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the modifications of this
  method. While there are some applications of CRM designs in recent Phase I
  trials, the standard method (SM) of escalating doses after three patients
  with an option for an additional three patients SM remains very popular,
  mainly due to its simplicity. From a practical perspective, clinicians are
  interested in designs that can estimate the MTD using fewer patients for a
  fixed number of doses, or can test more dose levels for a given sample size.
  Purpose This article compares CRM-based methods with the SM in terms of the
  number of patients needed to reach the MTD, total sample size required, and
  trial duration. Methods The comparisons are performed under two alternative
  schemes: a fixed or a varying sample approach with the implementation of a
  stopping rule. The stopping rule halts the trial if the confidence interval
  around the MTD is within a pre-specified bound. Our simulations evaluated
  several CRM-based methods under different scenarios by varying the number of
  dose levels from five to eight and the location of the true MTD. Results CRM
  and SM are comparable in terms of how fast they reach the MTD and the total
  sample size required when testing a limited number of dose levels (≤5), but
  as the number of dose levels increases, CRM reaches the MTD in fewer patients
  when used with a fixed sample of 20 patients. However, a sample size of
  20—25 patients is not sufficient to achieve a narrow precision around the
  estimated toxicity rate at the MTD. Limitations We focused on methods with
  practical design features that are of interest to clinicians. However, there
  are several alternative CRM-based designs that are not investigated in this
  manuscript, and hence our results are not generalizable to other designs.
  Conclusions We show that CRM-based methods are an improvement over the SM in
  terms of accuracy and optimal dose allocation in almost all cases, except
  when the true dose is among the lower levels. Clinical Trials 2008; 5:

    The traditional method (TM), also known as the 3+3 up-and-down design, and
  the continual reassessment method (CRM) are commonly used in Phase I oncology
  trials to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The rolling-6 is a
  relative newcomer which was developed to shorten trial duration by minimizing
  the period of time during which the trial is closed to accrual for toxicity
  assessment. In this manuscript we have compared the performance of these
  three approaches via simulations not only with respect to the usual
  parameters such as overall toxicity, sample size and percentage of patients
  treated at doses above the MTD but also in terms of trial duration and the
  dose chosen as the MTD. Our results indicate that the toxicity rates are
  comparable across the three designs, but the TM and the rolling-6 tend to
  treat a higher percentage of patients at doses below the MTD. With respect to
  trial duration, rolling-6 leads to shorter trials compared to the TM but not
  compared to the CRM. Additionally, the doses identified as the MTD by the TM
  and the rolling-6 differ in a large percentage of trials. Our results also
  indicate that the body surface area-based dosing used in pediatric trials can
  make a difference in dose escalation/de-escalation patterns in the CRM
  compared to the cases where such variations are not taken into account in the
  calculations, even leading to different MTDs in some cases.%

    This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1
  clinical trials in cancer. The basic idea and motivation behind the approach
  stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation
  with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that
  for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little
  interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given
  targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which
  all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this
  level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical
  requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are
  that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity
  level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic
  response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at
  a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real
  promise.%

    Purpose Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine
  suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in
  that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This
  study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective
  statistical designs to clinical practice. Methods We examined abstract
  records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database
  between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials)
  and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We
  then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical
  designs. Results One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90
  statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6\% of the phase I cancer trials
  (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical
  studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication
  of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20
  clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used
  variations of the standard up-and-down method. Conclusion A consequence of
  using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses
  outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that
  up-and-down designs treated only 35\% of patients at optimal dose levels
  versus 55\% for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of
  treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies
  (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the
  adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated
  at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly
  targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have
  different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit
  from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities,
  late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in
  the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of
  adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles
  published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials
  were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug
  studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591
  (92.9\%) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4\%; range 2.3\% in 2009 to
  9.7\% in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the
  trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy
  trials, 5.8\% used model-based methods, compared to 3.9\% and 8.3\% of the
  chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of
  trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption
  of these designs continues to remain low.%

  All designs are implemented with a common interface. We also offer optional
  additional classes to tailor the behaviour of all designs, including avoiding
  skipping doses, stopping after n patients have been treated at the
  recommended dose, stopping when a toxicity condition is met, or demanding
  that n patients are treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining
  together these classes using the pipe operator from 'magrittr', it is simple
  to tailor the behaviour of a dose-finding design so it behaves how the
  trialist wants. Having provided a flexible interface for specifying designs,
  we then provide functions to run simulations and calculate dose-paths for
  future cohorts of patients.%

    Sample size determination is among the most commonly encountered tasks in
  statistical practice. A broad range of frequentist and Bayesian methods for
  sample size determination can be described as choosing the smallest sample
  that is sufficient to achieve some set of goals. An example for the
  frequentist is seeking the smallest sample size that is sufficient to achieve
  a desired power at a specified significance level. An example for the
  Bayesian is seeking the smallest sample size necessary to obtain, in
  expectation, a desired rate of correct classification of the hypothesis as
  true or false. This article explores parallels between Bayesian and
  frequentist methods for determining sample size. We provide a simple but
  general and pragmatic framework for investigating the relationship between
  the two approaches, based on identifying mappings to connect the Bayesian and
  frequentist inputs necessary to obtain the same sample size. We illustrate
  this mapping with examples, highlighting a somewhat surprising “approximate
  functional correspondence” between power-based and information-based
  optimal sample sizes.%

    Background Bayesian predictive probabilities can be used for interim
  monitoring of clinical trials to estimate the probability of observing a
  statistically significant treatment effect if the trial were to continue to
  its predefined maximum sample size. Purpose We explore settings in which
  Bayesian predictive probabilities are advantageous for interim monitoring
  compared to Bayesian posterior probabilities, p-values, conditional power, or
  group sequential methods. Results For interim analyses that address
  prediction hypotheses, such as futility monitoring and efficacy monitoring
  with lagged outcomes, only predictive probabilities properly account for the
  amount of data remaining to be observed in a clinical trial and have the
  flexibility to incorporate additional information via auxiliary variables.
  Limitations Computational burdens limit the feasibility of predictive
  probabilities in many clinical trial settings. The specification of prior
  distributions brings additional challenges for regulatory approval.
  Conclusions The use of Bayesian predictive probabilities enables the choice
  of logical interim stopping rules that closely align with the clinical
  decision-making process.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    As the temporal, financial, and ethical cost of randomized clinical trials
  (RCTs) continues to rise, researchers and regulators in drug discovery and
  development face increasing pressure to make better use of existing data
  sources. This pressure is especially high in rare disease, where
  traditionally designed RCTs are often infeasible due to the inability to
  recruit enough patients or the unwillingness of patients or trial leaders to
  randomly assign anyone to placebo. Bayesian statistical methods have recently
  been recommended in such settings for their ability to combine disparate data
  sources, increasing overall study power. The use of these methods has
  received a boost in the United States thanks to a new willingness by
  regulators at the Food and Drug Administration to consider complex innovative
  trial designs. These designs allow trialists to change the nature of the
  trial (eg, stop early for success or futility, drop an underperforming trial
  arm, incorporate data on historical controls, etc) while it is still running.
  In this article, we review a broad collection of Bayesian techniques useful
  in rare disease research, indicating the benefits and risks associated with
  each. We begin with relatively innocuous methods for combining information
  from RCTs and proceed on through increasingly innovative approaches that
  borrow strength from increasingly heterogeneous and less carefully curated
  data sources. We also offer 2 examples from the very recent literature
  illustrating how clinical pharmacology principles can make important
  contributions to such designs, confirming the interdisciplinary nature of
  this work.%

    The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was proposed to
  handle the problem of long trial duration in Phase\,1 trials as a result of
  late-onset toxicities. Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials
  of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the
  dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity
  probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of
  treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known
  at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM)
  was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to
  the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in
  terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of
  the trial.%

    In dose-finding trials of chemotherapeutic agents, the goal of identifying
  the maximum tolerated dose is usually determined by considering information
  on toxicity only, with the assumption that the highest safe dose also
  provides the most promising outlook for efficacy. Trials of molecularly
  targeted agents challenge accepted dose-finding methods because minimal
  toxicity may arise over all doses under consideration and higher doses may
  not result in greater response. In this article, we propose a new early-phase
  method for trials investigating targeted agents. We provide simulation
  results illustrating the operating characteristics of our design.%

    The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates
  efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity.
  Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs
  in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional
  rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains
  limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP),
  which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic
  challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in
  advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients
  (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated
  information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties,
  we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's
  specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In
  particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should
  be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement
  a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid
  leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown,
  complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each
  dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for
  each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design
  and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored
  model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the
  co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs
  by statisticians and investigators. Clin Cancer Res; 23(24); 7440–7. ©2017

    \field{abstract}{%
    Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common, morbid, and
  frequently lethal malignancy. To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed
  whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority
  exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human
  papilloma virus was detectable by sequencing of DNA from infected tumors. In
  addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN,
  PIK3CA, and HRAS), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated
  in this malignancy. At least 30\% of cases harbored mutations in genes that
  regulate squamous differentiation (e.g., NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating
  its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally,
  the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal
  fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms.%

    Aims This paper compares the predictions of radiotherapy demand for England
  from the Malthus model with those from the earlier National Radiotherapy
  Advisory Group (NRAG) model, from the international literature and also with
  observed radiotherapy usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English
  radiotherapy dataset (RTDS). Materials and methods We reviewed the evidence
  base for radiotherapy for each type and stage of cancer using national and
  international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and key clinical
  trials. Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and radiotherapy demand
  was calculated using English cancer incidence data for 2007, 2008 and 2009,
  accurate to the Primary Care Trust (PCT) level (population
  91~500–1~282~384). The stage at presentation was obtained from English
  cancer registry data. In predictive mode, the model can take account of
  changes in cancer incidence as the population grows and ages. Results The
  Malthus model indicates reduced indications for radiotherapy, principally for
  lung cancer and rarer tumours. Our estimate of the proportion of patients who
  should receive radiotherapy at some stage of their illness is 40.6\%. This is
  lower than previous estimates of about 50\%. Nevertheless, the overall
  estimate of demand in terms of attendances is similar for the NRAG and
  Malthus models. The latter models that 48~827 attendances should have been
  delivered per million population in 2011. National data from RTDS show 32~071
  attendances per million in 2011. A 50\% increase in activity would be
  required to match estimated demand. This underprovision extends across all
  cancers and represents reduced access and the use of dose fractionation at
  odds with international norms of evidence-based practice. By 2016, demand is
  predicted to grow to about 55~206 attendances per million and by 2020 to
  60~057. Discussion Services have increased their activity by 14\% between
  2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by 11\%. Access remains low
  and English radiotherapy dose fractionation still does not comply with
  international evidence-based practice.%

    Since the inception of this journal in 1948, the understanding of etiologic
  factors that contribute to and the treatment of head and neck cancer has
  evolved dramatically. Advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and
  chemotherapy have improved locoregional control, survival, and quality of
  life. The outcomes of these treatment modalities have shifted the focus of
  curative efforts from radical ablation to preservation and restoration of
  function. This evolution has been documented in the pages of Cancer for the
  past 6 decades. This review focuses on the evolution of treatment approaches
  for head and neck cancer and future directions while recognizing the historic
  contributions recorded within this journal.%

    Background Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of
  chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains
  uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on
  chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. Methods We updated data on all
  patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients
  with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx.
  Findings The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10\hphantom{,}741 patients) of
  locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard
  ratio of death of 0·90 (95\% CI 0·85–0·94, p{$<$}0·0001), corresponding
  to an absolute survival benefit of 4\% at 2 and 5 years in favour of
  chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy
  gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm
  conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating
  radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0·91 (0·79–1·06) in favour
  of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation
  trails (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with
  neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery
  and radiotherapy in non responders. The hazard ratio of death in the
  chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1·19 (0·97–1·46).
  Interpretation Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant
  survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy
  is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of
  chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure
  must remain investigational.%

    An underlying hallmark of cancers is their genomic instability, which is
  associated with a greater propensity to accumulate DNA damage. Historical
  treatment of cancer by radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy is based on
  this principle, yet it is accompanied by significant collateral damage to
  normal tissue and unwanted side effects. Targeted therapy based on inhibiting
  the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancers offers the potential for a greater
  therapeutic window by tailoring treatment to patients with tumors lacking
  specific DDR functions. The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly
  (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1
  or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle,
  exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an
  Achilles’ heel. This review highlights the different concepts behind
  targeting DDR in cancer and how this can provide significant opportunities
  for DDR-based therapies in the future.%

    The overwhelming majority of dose-escalation clinical trials use methods
  that seek a maximum tolerable dose, including rule-based methods like the
  3+3, and model-based methods like CRM and EWOC. These methods assume that the
  incidences of efficacy and toxicity always increase as dose is increased.
  This assumption is widely accepted with cytotoxic therapies. In recent
  decades, however, the search for novel cancer treatments has broadened,
  increasingly focusing on inhibitors and antibodies. The rationale that higher
  doses are always associated with superior efficacy is less clear for these
  types of therapies.%

    Summary. Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each
  patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the
  next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating
  late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents,
  this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new
  method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM),
  that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension
  of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990,
  Biometrics46, 33–48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can
  be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We
  prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the
  correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's
  accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much
  shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by
  the CRM could be reduced to 2–4 years by our method.%

    Summary. We propose an adaptive two-stage Bayesian design for finding one
  or more acceptable dose combinations of two cytotoxic agents used together in
  a Phase I clinical trial. The method requires that each of the two agents has
  been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the
  case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of
  toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters
  characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either
  elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical
  data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent
  interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is
  described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and
  cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Summary. Treating patients with a combination of agents is becoming
  commonplace in cancer clinical trials, with biochemical synergism often the
  primary focus. In a typical drug combination trial, the toxicity profile of
  each individual drug has already been thoroughly studied in single-agent
  trials, which naturally offers rich prior information. We propose a Bayesian
  adaptive design for dose finding that is based on a copula-type model to
  account for the synergistic effect of two or more drugs in combination. To
  search for the maximum tolerated dose combination, we continuously update the
  posterior estimates for the toxicity probabilities of the combined doses. By
  reordering the dose toxicities in the two-dimensional probability space, we
  adaptively assign each new cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose.
  Dose escalation, de-escalation or staying at the same doses is determined by
  comparing the posterior estimates of the probabilities of toxicity of
  combined doses and the prespecified toxicity target. We conduct extensive
  simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design and
  illustrate the proposed method under various practical scenarios.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of
  phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single
  cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally
  tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable
  level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity
  of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent
  trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be
  expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of
  patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because
  the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for
  several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the
  orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a
  partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional
  dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the
  continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and
  Fisher (1990,\enspace Biometrics 46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully
  known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic
  dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a
  CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for
  partial orders.%

    A major practical impediment when implementing adaptive dose-finding
  designs is that the toxicity outcome used by the decision rules may not be
  observed shortly after the initiation of the treatment. To address this
  issue, we propose the data augmentation continual re-assessment method
  (DA-CRM) for dose finding. By naturally treating the unobserved toxicities as
  missing data, we show that such missing data are nonignorable in the sense
  that the missingness depends on the unobserved outcomes. The Bayesian data
  augmentation approach is used to sample both the missing data and model
  parameters from their posterior full conditional distributions. We evaluate
  the performance of the DA-CRM through extensive simulation studies, and also
  compare it with other existing methods. The results show that the proposed
  design satisfactorily resolves the issues related to late-onset toxicities
  and possesses desirable operating characteristics: treating patients more
  safely, and also selecting the maximum tolerated dose with a higher
  probability. The new DA-CRM is illustrated with two phase I cancer clinical
  trials.%

    The product of independent beta probabilities escalation (PIPE) design for
  dual-agent phase I dose-escalation trials is a Bayesian model-free approach
  for identifying multiple maximum tolerated dose combinations of novel
  combination therapies. Despite only being published in 2015, the PIPE design
  has been implemented in at least two oncology trials. However, these trials
  require patients to have completed follow-up before clinicians can make
  dose-escalation decisions. For trials of radiotherapy or advanced
  therapeutics, this may lead to impractically long trial durations due to
  late-onset treatment-related toxicities. In this paper, we extend the PIPE
  design to use censored time-to-event (TITE) toxicity outcomes for making dose
  escalation decisions. We show via comprehensive simulation studies and
  sensitivity analyses that trial duration can be reduced by up to 35\%,
  particularly when recruitment is faster than expected, without compromising
  on other operating characteristics.%

    In studies of combinations of agents in phase I oncology trials, the
  dose–toxicity relationship may not be monotone for all combinations, in
  which case the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order. The continual
  reassessment method for partial orders (PO-CRM) is a design for phase I
  trials of combinations that leans upon identifying possible complete orders
  associated with the partial order. This article addresses some practical
  design considerations not previously undertaken when describing the PO-CRM.
  We describe an approach in choosing a proper subset of possible orderings,
  formulated according to the known toxicity relationships within a matrix of
  combination therapies. Other design issues, such as working model selection
  and stopping rules, are also discussed. We demonstrate the practical ability
  of PO-CRM as a phase I design for combinations through its use in a recent
  trial designed at the University of Virginia Cancer Center.%

    Phase I trials evaluating the safety of multi-drug combinations are
  becoming more common in oncology. Despite the emergence of novel methodology
  in the area, it is rare that innovative approaches are used in practice. In
  this article, we review three methods for Phase I combination studies that
  are easy to understand and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the
  operating characteristics of the designs through illustration in a single

  increasing the use of novel approaches in phase I combination studies. Design
  specifications and software capabilities are also discussed.%

    Background Despite multimodality treatments including neurosurgery,
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains poor. GBM
  is classically considered as a radioresistant tumor, because of its high
  local recurrence rate, inside the irradiation field. The development of new
  radiosensitizer is crucial to improve the patient outcomes. Pre-clinical data
  showed that Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) could be
  considered as a promising class of radiosensitizer., The aim of this study is
  to evaluate Olaparib, a PARPi, as radiosensitizing agent, combined with the
  Stupp protocol, namely temozolomide (TMZ) and intensity modulated
  radiotherapy (IMRT) in first line treatment of partially or non-resected GBM.
  Methods The OLA-TMZ-RTE-01 study is a multicenter non-randomized phase I/IIa
  trial including unresectable or partially resectable GBM patients, from 18 to
  70\,years old. A two-step dose-escalation phase I design will first determine
  the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of olaparib, delivered concomitantly with
  TMZ plus conventional irradiation for 6\,weeks and as single agent for
  4\,weeks (radiotherapy period), and second, the RP2D of olaparib combined
  with adjuvant TMZ (maintenance period). Phase IIa will assess the 18-month
  overall survival (OS) of this combination. In both phase I and IIa separately
  considered, the progression-free survival, the objective response rate, the
  neurocognitive functions of patients, emotional disorders among caregivers,
  the survival without toxicity, degradation nor progression, the complications
  onset and the morphologic and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
  parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives. Ancillary
  objectives will explore alteration of the DNA repair pathways on biopsy
  tumor, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy parameters to differentiate
  tumor relapse and radionecrosis, and an expanded cognition evaluation. Up to
  79 patients will be enrolled: 30 patients in the phase I and 49 patients in
  the phase IIa. Discussion Combining PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, with
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy in GBM may improve survival outcomes, while
  sparing healthy tissue and preserving neurocognitive function, given the
  replication-dependent efficacy of olaparib, and the increased PARP expression
  in GBM as compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue. Ancillary studies will
  help to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of PARPi efficacy as
  radiosensitizer. Trial registration NCT03212742, registered June, 7, 2017.

    Delayed dose limiting toxicities (i.e. beyond first cycle of treatment) is
  a challenge for phase I trials. The time-to-event continual reassessment
  method (TITE-CRM) is a Bayesian dose-finding design to address the issue of
  long observation time and early patient drop-out. It uses a weighted binomial
  likelihood with weights assigned to observations by the unknown
  time-to-toxicity distribution, and is open to accrual continually. To avoid
  dosing at overly toxic levels while retaining accuracy and efficiency for DLT
  evaluation that involves multiple cycles, we propose an adaptive weight
  function by incorporating cyclical data of the experimental treatment with
  parameters updated continually. This provides a reasonable estimate for the
  time-to-toxicity distribution by accounting for inter-cycle variability and
  maintains the statistical properties of consistency and coherence. A case
  study of a First-in-Human trial in cancer for an experimental biologic is
  presented using the proposed design. Design calibrations for the clinical and
  statistical parameters are conducted to ensure good operating
  characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed TITE-CRM design
  with adaptive weight function yields significantly shorter trial duration,
  does not expose patients to additional risk, is competitive against the
  existing weighting methods, and possesses some desirable properties.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The continual reassessment method as described by O'Quigley, Pepe, and
  Fisher (1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48) leans to a large extent upon a Bayesian
  methodology. Initial experimentation and sequential updating are carried out
  in a natural way within the context of a Bayesian framework. In this paper we
  argue that such a framework is easily changed to a more classic one leaning
  upon likelihood theory. The essential features of the continual reassessment
  method remain unchanged. In particular, large sample properties are the same
  unless the prior is degenerate. For small samples, and as far as the final
  recommended dose level is concerned, simulations indicate that there is not
  much to choose between a likelihood approach and a Bayesian one. However, for
  in-trial allocation of dose levels to patients, there are some differences
  and these are discussed. In contrast to the Bayesian approach, a likelihood
  one requires some extra effort to get off the ground. This is because the
  likelihood equation has no solution until we observe a toxicity. Initially
  then we suggest working with either a standard Up-and-Down scheme or standard
  continual reassessment method until toxicity is observed and then switching
  to the new scheme.%

    Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by
  pseudo-random sampling. A key strength of simulation studies is the ability
  to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth”
  (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of
  generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such
  as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed,
  analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using
  simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis,
  reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a
  structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which
  involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and
  performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation
  studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key
  performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular
  and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With
  a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from
  Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation
  study and identify areas for improvement.%

    The majority of methods for the design of Phase I trials in oncology are
  based upon a single course of therapy, yet in actual practice it may be the
  case that there is more than one treatment schedule for any given dose.
  Therefore, the probability of observing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) may
  depend upon both the total amount of the dose given, as well as the frequency
  with which it is administered. The objective of the study then becomes to
  find an acceptable combination of both dose and schedule. Past literature on
  designing these trials has entailed the assumption that toxicity increases
  monotonically with both dose and schedule. In this article, we relax this
  assumption for schedules and present a dose-schedule finding design that can
  be generalized to situations in which we know the ordering between all
  schedules and those in which we do not. We present simulation results that
  compare our method to other suggested dose-schedule finding methodology.%

    There is a growing medical interest in combining several agents and
  optimizing their dosing schedules in a single trial in order to optimize the
  treatment for patients. Evaluating at doses of several drugs and their
  scheduling in a single Phase I trial simultaneously possess a number of
  statistical challenges, and specialized methods to tackle these have been
  proposed in the literature. However, the uptake of these methods is slow and
  implementation examples of such advanced methods are still sparse to date. In
  this work, we share our experience of proposing a model-based partial
  ordering continual reassessment method (POCRM) design for three-dimensional
  dose-finding in an oncology trial. In the trial, doses of two agents and the
  dosing schedule of one of them can be escalated/de-escalated. We provide a
  step-by-step summary on how the POCRM design was implemented and communicated
  to the trial team. We proposed an approach to specify toxicity orderings and
  their a-priori probabilities, and developed a number of visualization tools
  to communicate the statistical properties of the design. The design
  evaluation included both a comprehensive simulation study and considerations
  of the individual trial behavior. The study is now enrolling patients. We
  hope that sharing our experience of the successful implementation of an
  advanced design in practice that went through evaluations of several health
  authorities will facilitate a better uptake of more efficient methods in
  practice.%

    Cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs primarily damage proliferating cells and we
  now know the molecular target of most of the drugs in clinical use. Even so,
  non-specificity of cytotoxic agents is a major drawback and potential to
  damage normal tissues means that cure with chemotherapy is not often
  achieved. With advances in science, rational drug design is now becoming a
  reality, but these mechanism-driven, targeted agents are likely to be
  additions to, rather than substitutes for, conventional chemotherapy drugs.
  As cancer treatment becomes increasingly complex, the challenge for

    The treatment of certain cancers has been revolutionised in recent years by
  the introduction of novel drugs designed to target specific molecular factors
  implicated in tumour growth. Notable examples include trastuzumab, a
  humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human epidermal growth factor
  receptor (HER)-2 in women with HER2-positive breast cancer; rituximab, an
  anti-CD20 mAb in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; imatinib, a tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor in KIT-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumours and
  sunitinib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in metastatic renal cell
  carcinoma. For regulatory reasons, new molecular targeted agents are first
  evaluated in advanced and metastatic disease, wherein they prolong survival.
  However, their most profound impact has been observed in the adjuvant
  setting, where they may contribute to curative therapy rather than mere
  palliation. Expansion in the use of molecular targeted therapies will have
  important cost implications for health care systems. Although expensive, on a
  monthly basis, molecular targeted therapies may not be more costly than
  treatments for other major chronic diseases, especially considering the
  contribution of cancer to the global disease burden, the associated
  socioeconomic costs and the long-term benefits of therapy. Nevertheless, the
  use of these agents must be optimised, in part using molecular biomarkers
  associated with drug response.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Phase I cancer clinical trials are small dose-finding studies designed to
  rapidly identify the optimal dose of a new anticancer agent. The optimal dose
  has been defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for conventional
  cytotoxic anticancer drugs, and this dose is typically recommended as the
  phase II dose. In the past two decades, a new approach for cancer treatment
  has emerged. This approach, now widely referred to as molecularly targeted
  therapy is designed a priori, based on the knowledge of various physiological
  molecules that have been obtained by the development of molecular biology.
  Most molecularly targeted agents slow or stop the growth of tumors. Such
  agents are, in general, less toxic than conventional cytotoxic agents; as a
  result, the maximum therapeutic effect may occur at doses well below the MTD.
  With the emergence of a growing number of molecularly targeted agents,
  approaches to early drug development are changing. We present dose-finding
  designs for phase I clinical trials of molecularly targeted drugs. There is
  an increasing need to develop designs to find the optimal biological dose
  (OBD) for molecularly targeted agents, and the utility of designs needs to be
  prospectively evaluated in future clinical dose-finding trials for a variety
  of molecularly targeted agents.%

    Traditional phase I studies find the therapeutic dose of an investigational
  drug based solely on toxicity and without regard to the drug's efficacy. We
  propose extending the continual reassessment method (CRM) to a bivariate
  trial design in which the maximum tolerated dose is based jointly on both
  toxicity and disease progression. We call our study design bCRM, for
  bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to
  find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune
  suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate
  through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and
  compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to
  designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some
  direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and
  distributions to use with a bivariate study design.%

    We present an adaptive Bayesian method for dose-finding in phase I/II
  clinical trials based on trade-offs between the probabilities of treatment
  efficacy and toxicity. The method accommodates either trinary or bivariate
  binary outcomes, as well as efficacy probabilities that possibly are
  nonmonotone in dose. Doses are selected for successive patient cohorts based
  on a set of efficacy-toxicity trade-off contours that partition the
  two-dimensional outcome probability domain. Priors are established by solving
  for hyperparameters that optimize the fit of the model to elicited mean
  outcome probabilities. For trinary outcomes, the new algorithm is compared to
  the method of Thall and Russell (1998, Biometrics 54, 251-264) by application
  to a trial of rapid treatment for ischemic stroke. The bivariate binary
  outcome case is illustrated by a trial of graft-versus-host disease treatment
  in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Computer simulations show that,
  under a wide rage of dose-outcome scenarios, the new method has high
  probabilities of making correct decisions and treats most patients at doses
  with desirable efficacy-toxicity trade-offs.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the objective of dose
  finding is often to identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), rather than
  the maximum tolerated dose. We develop a utility-based Bayesian optimal
  interval (U-BOIN) phase I/II design to find the OBD. We jointly model
  toxicity and efficacy using a multinomial-Dirichlet model, and employ a
  utility function to measure dose risk-benefit trade-off. The U-BOIN design
  consists of two seamless stages. In stage I, the Bayesian optimal interval
  design is used to quickly explore the dose space and collect preliminary
  toxicity and efficacy data. In stage II, we continuously update the posterior
  estimate of the utility for each dose after each cohort, using accumulating
  efficacy and toxicity from both stages I and II, and then use the posterior
  estimate to direct the dose assignment and selection. Compared to existing
  phase I/II designs, one prominent advantage of the U-BOIN design is its
  simplicity for implementation. Once the trial is designed, it can be easily
  applied using predetermined decision tables, without complex model fitting
  and estimation. Our simulation study shows that, despite its simplicity, the
  U-BOIN design is robust and has high accuracy to identify the OBD. We extend
  the design to accommodate delayed efficacy by leveraging the short-term
  endpoint (eg, immune activity or other biological activity of targeted
  agents), and using it to predict the delayed efficacy outcome to facilitate
  real-time decision making. A user-friendly software to implement the U-BOIN
  is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.%

    Novel therapies are challenging the standards of drug development. Agents
  with specific biologic targets and limited toxicity require novel designs to
  determine doses to be taken forward into larger studies. In this paper, we
  describe an approach that incorporates both toxicity and efficacy data into
  the estimation of the biologically optimal dose of an agent in a phase I
  trial. The approach is based on the flexible continuation-ratio model, and
  uses straightforward optimal dose selection criteria. Dose selection is based
  on all patients treated up until that time point, using a continual
  reassessment method approach. Dose–outcome curves considered include
  monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and unimodal curves. Our
  simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed design, which we call
  TriCRM, has favourable operating characteristics. Copyright © 2005 John

    With the emergence of immunotherapy and other novel therapies, the
  traditional assumption that the efficacy of the study drug increases
  monotonically with dose levels is not always true. Therefore, dose-finding
  methods evaluating only toxicity data may not be adequate. In this paper, we
  have first compared the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) and
  Toxicity Equivalence Range (TEQR) dose-finding oncology designs for safety
  with identical stopping rules; we have then extended both designs to include
  efficacy in addition to safety – we determine the optimal dose for safety
  and efficacy using these designs by applying isotonic regression to the
  observed toxicity and efficacy rates, once the early phase trial is
  completed. We consider multiple types of underlying dose response curves,
  i.e., monotonically increasing, plateau, or umbrella-shaped. We conduct
  simulation studies to investigate the operating characteristics of the two
  proposed designs and compare them to existing designs. We found that the
  extended mTPI design selects the optimal dose for safety and efficacy more
  accurately than the other designs for most of the scenarios considered.%

    The 3 + 3 design is the most common choice among clinicians for phase I
  dose-escalation oncology trials. In recent reviews, more than 95\% of phase I
  trials have been based on the 3 + 3 design. Given that it is intuitive and
  its implementation does not require a computer program, clinicians can
  conduct 3 + 3 dose escalations in practice with virtually no logistic cost,
  and trial protocols based on the 3 + 3 design pass institutional review board
  and biostatistics reviews quickly. However, the performance of the 3 + 3
  design has rarely been compared with model-based designs in simulation
  studies with matched sample sizes. In the vast majority of statistical
  literature, the 3 + 3 design has been shown to be inferior in identifying
  true maximum-tolerated doses (MTDs), although the sample size required by the
  3 + 3 design is often orders-of-magnitude smaller than model-based designs.
  In this article, through comparative simulation studies with matched sample
  sizes, we demonstrate that the 3 + 3 design has higher risks of exposing
  patients to toxic doses above the MTD than the modified toxicity probability
  interval (mTPI) design, a newly developed adaptive method. In addition,
  compared with the mTPI design, the 3 + 3 design does not yield higher
  probabilities in identifying the correct MTD, even when the sample size is
  matched. Given that the mTPI design is equally transparent, costless to
  implement with free software, and more flexible in practical situations, we
  highly encourage its adoption in early dose-escalation studies whenever the 3
  + 3 design is also considered. We provide free software to allow direct
  comparisons of the 3 + 3 design with other model-based designs in simulation
  studies with matched sample sizes.%

    Purpose This paper introduces the target equivalence range (TEQR) design, a
  frequentist implementation of the modified toxicity probability interval
  (mTPI) design, as a competitor to the standard 3+3 design (3+3). The 3+3 is
  the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose
  exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of
  toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Its main competitor, the
  continual reassessment method (CRM) has not found a true niche in the Phase I
  armamentarium resulting from statistical and implementation complexities.
  Methods We describe the four competing designs (3+3, mTPI, CRM, and TEQR),
  comparing them based on i) operating characteristics from simulated trials,
  and ii) ease of implementation. Results The TEQR is better than the 3+3 when
  compared on; 1) number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity
  level was selected as the MTD, 2) number of patients assigned to dose levels
  at or nearest the MTD, 3) overall trial dose limiting toxicity rate and 4)
  accuracy and precision of estimates for the rate of toxicity at the MTD.
  Further it is reasonably comparable to the CRM and mTPI on 1–3. Conclusion
  The TEQR offers trial designers a competitor to the 3+3 for ease of
  implementation with better operating characteristics and the added attraction
  of a glimpse of activity at the MTD. The R package TEQR, freely available
  from the comprehensive R archive network, includes functions to calculate
  dose escalation guidelines and operating characteristics.%

    Conventionally, phase I dose-finding trials aim to determine the maximum
  tolerated dose of a new drug under the assumption that both toxicity and
  efficacy monotonically increase with the dose. This paradigm, however, is not
  suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies,
  for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus.
  For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose,
  defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We
  develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose.
  We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the
  increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose–efficacy relationship. We take
  the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy
  is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the
  posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively
  assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the
  proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to
  be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is
  available for this specific setting. We also provide an R package dfmta that
  can be downloaded from CRAN website.%

    A balanced treatment of the theories, methodologies, and design issues
  involved in clinical trials using statistical methods There has been enormous
  interest and development in Bayesian adaptive designs, especially for early
  phases of clinical trials. However, for phase III trials, frequentist methods
  still play a dominant role through controlling type I and type II errors in
  the hypothesis testing framework. From practical perspectives, Clinical Trial
  Design: Bayesian and Frequentist Adaptive Methods provides comprehensive
  coverage of both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to all phases of
  clinical trial design. Before underpinning various adaptive methods, the book
  establishes an overview of the fundamentals of clinical trials as well as a
  comparison of Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Recognizing that clinical
  trial design is one of the most important and useful skills in the
  pharmaceutical industry, this book provides detailed discussions on a variety
  of statistical designs, their properties, and operating characteristics for
  phase I, II, and III clinical trials as well as an introduction to phase IV
  trials. Many practical issues and challenges arising in clinical trials are
  addressed. Additional topics of coverage include: Risk and benefit analysis
  for toxicity and efficacy trade-offs Bayesian predictive probability trial
  monitoring Bayesian adaptive randomization Late onset toxicity and response
  Dose finding in drug combination trials Targeted therapy designs The author
  utilizes cutting-edge clinical trial designs and statistical methods that
  have been employed at the world's leading medical centers as well as in the
  pharmaceutical industry. The software used throughout the book is freely
  available on the book's related website, equipping readers with the necessary
  tools for designing clinical trials. Clinical Trial Design is an excellent
  book for courses on the topic at the graduate level. The book also serves as
  a valuable reference for statisticians and biostatisticians in the
  pharmaceutical industry as well as for researchers and practitioners who
  design, conduct, and monitor clinical trials in their everyday work.%

    In this article, we propose and evaluate three alternative randomization
  strategies to the adaptive randomization (AR) stage used in a seamless Phase
  I/II dose-finding design. The original design was proposed by Wages and Tait
  in 2015 for trials of molecularly targeted agents in cancer treatments, where
  dose-efficacy assumptions are not always monotonically increasing. Our goal
  is to improve the design’s overall performance regarding the estimation of
  optimal dose as well as patient allocation to effective treatments. The
  proposed methods calculate randomization probabilities based on the
  likelihood of every candidate model as opposed to the original design which
  selects the best model and then randomizes doses based on estimations from
  the selected model. Unlike the original method, our proposed adaption does
  not require an arbitrarily specified sample size for the adaptive
  randomization stage. Simulations are used to compare the proposed strategies
  and a final strategy is recommended. Under most scenarios, our recommended
  method allocates more patients to the optimal dose while improving accuracy
  in selecting the final optimal dose without increasing the overall risk of
  toxicity.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a model-based design for phase I
  trials, which aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new therapy.
  The CRM has been shown to be more accurate in targeting the MTD than
  traditional rule-based approaches such as the 3\,+\,3 design, which is used
  in most phase I trials. Furthermore, the CRM has been shown to assign more
  trial participants at or close to the MTD than the 3\,+\,3 design. However,
  the CRM’s uptake in clinical research has been incredibly slow, putting
  trial participants, drug development and patients at risk. Barriers to
  increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of
  knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in
  practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians
  on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available. Furthermore,
  practical resources to support clinicians considering the CRM for their
  trials are scarce.%

    Provides the dose transition pathways (DTP) to project in advance the doses

    \field{abstract}{%
    As clinicians begin to realize the important role of dose-finding in the
  drug development process, there is an increasing openness to "novel" methods
  proposed in the past two decades. In particular, the Continual Reassessment
  Method (CRM) and its variations have drawn much attention in the medical
  community, though it has yet to become a commonplace tool. To overcome the
  status quo in phase I clinical trials, statisticians must be able to design
  trials using the CRM in a timely and reproducible manner. A self-contained
  theoretical framework of the CRM for researchers and graduate students who
  set out to learn and do research in the CRM and dose-finding methods in
  general, Dose Finding by the Continual Reassessment Method features: Real
  clinical trial examples that illustrate the methods and techniques throughout
  the book Detailed calibration techniques that enable biostatisticians to
  design a CRM in timely manner Limitations of the CRM are outlined to aid in
  correct use of method This book supplies practical, efficient dose-finding
  methods based on cutting edge statistical research. More than just a
  cookbook, it provides full, unified coverage of the CRM in addition to
  step-by-step guidelines to automation and parameterization of the methods
  used on a regular basis. A detailed exposition of the calibration of the CRM
  for applied statisticians working with dose-finding in phase I trials, the
  book focuses on the R package ‘dfcrm’ for the CRM and its major variants.
  The author recognizes clinicians’ skepticism of model-based designs, and
  addresses their concerns that the time, professional, and computational
  resources necessary for accurate model-based designs can be major bottlenecks
  to the widespread use of appropriate dose-finding methods in phase I
  practice. The theoretically- and empirically-based methods in Dose Finding by
  the Continual Reassessment Method will lessen the statistician’s burden and
  encourage the continuing development and implementation of model-based
  dose-finding methods.%

    Background In recent years, the success rate of confirmatory studies has
  been poor resulting in more emphasis on the conduct of exploratory studies.
  As one possibility to improve decision-making during the early stages of
  development, adaptive and Bayesian methods have been recommended. Purpose To
  investigate the current practice in designing early-phase studies in UK
  public sector research institutions and the use of adaptive and Bayesian
  methods in particular and to determine factors that hinder the penetration of
  methodological advances into practice. Methods A questionnaire was sent to
  all UK clinical trials units (CTUs) to gauge their involvement in early-phase
  studies and to learn about the designs used in these studies. Follow-up
  visits to units conducting early-phase studies with round-table discussions
  around the methods used and the obstacles faced when using adaptive methods
  were undertaken. Results More than half of the CTUs are involved in
  early-phase studies, but conservatism in the methods used in these studies is
  present. Reasons for novel methodology not being used include a lack of
  expertise, incompatible funding and unit structure, and a lack of software.
  Limitations Information is collected from UK CTUs, which undertake a large
  portion (but not all) publicly funded trials. Conclusions The use of adaptive
  and Bayesian methods for early-phase clinical studies in the UK public sector
  is at present limited. Various different initiatives aim to support and
  facilitate the use of these methods, however, so that an increased use of
  these methods can be anticipated in the future.%

    While guidance on statistical principles for clinical trials exists, there
  is an absence of guidance covering the required content of statistical
  analysis plans (SAPs) to support transparency and reproducibility.To develop
  recommendations for a minimum set of items that should be addressed in SAPs
  for clinical trials, developed with input from statisticians, previous
  guideline authors, journal editors, regulators, and funders.Funders and
  regulators (n\,=\,39) of randomized trials were contacted and the literature
  was searched to identify existing guidance; a survey of current practice was
  conducted across the network of UK Clinical Research
  Collaboration–registered trial units (n\,=\,46, 1 unit had 2 responders)
  and a Delphi survey (n\,=\,73 invited participants) was conducted to
  establish consensus on SAPs. The Delphi survey was sent to statisticians in
  trial units who completed the survey of current practice (n\,=\,46), CONSORT
  (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) and SPIRIT (Standard Protocol
  Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guideline authors
  (n\,=\,16), pharmaceutical industry statisticians (n\,=\,3), journal editors
  (n\,=\,9), and regulators (n\,=\,2) (3 participants were included in 2 groups
  each), culminating in a consensus meeting attended by experts (N\,=\,12) with
  representatives from each group. The guidance subsequently underwent critical
  review by statisticians from the surveyed trial units and members of the
  expert panel of the consensus meeting (N\,=\,51), followed by piloting of the
  guidance document in the SAPs of 5 trials.No existing guidance was
  identified. The registered trials unit survey (46 responses) highlighted
  diversity in current practice and confirmed support for developing guidance.
  The Delphi survey (54 of 73, 74\% participants completing both rounds)
  reached consensus on 42\% (n\,=\,46) of 110 items. The expert panel
  (N\,=\,12) agreed that 63 items should be included in the guidance, with an
  additional 17 items identified as important but may be referenced elsewhere.
  Following critical review and piloting, some overlapping items were combined,
  leaving 55 items.Recommendations are provided for a minimum set of items that
  should be addressed and included in SAPs for clinical trials. Trial
  registration, protocols, and statistical analysis plans are critically
  important in ensuring appropriate reporting of clinical trials.%

    Early phase dose-finding (EPDF) trials are crucial for the development of a
  new intervention and influence whether it should be investigated in further
  trials. Guidance exists for clinical trial protocols and completed trial
  reports in the SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines, respectively. However, both
  guidelines and their extensions do not adequately address the characteristics
  of EPDF trials. Building on the SPIRIT and CONSORT checklists, the DEFINE
  study aims to develop international consensus-driven guidelines for EPDF
  trial protocols (SPIRIT-DEFINE) and reports (CONSORT-DEFINE).%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The protocol of a clinical trial serves as the foundation for study
  planning, conduct, reporting, and appraisal. However, trial protocols and
  existing protocol guidelines vary greatly in content and quality. This
  article describes the systematic development and scope of SPIRIT (Standard
  Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013, a guideline
  for the minimum content of a clinical trial protocol., The 33-item SPIRIT
  checklist applies to protocols for all clinical trials and focuses on content
  rather than format. The checklist recommends a full description of what is
  planned; it does not prescribe how to design or conduct a trial. By providing
  guidance for key content, the SPIRIT recommendations aim to facilitate the
  drafting of high-quality protocols. Adherence to SPIRIT would also enhance
  the transparency and completeness of trial protocols for the benefit of
  investigators, trial participants, patients, sponsors, funders, research
  ethics committees or institutional review boards, peer reviewers, journals,
  trial registries, policymakers, regulators, and other key stakeholders.%

    \#\#\#\# Abstract Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of
  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent
  reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial
  findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent
  methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are
  associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error
  is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for
  evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias.
  A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated
  Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting
  of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement
  consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting
  an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial
  groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates
  critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT
  revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles
  underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write
  or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was
  published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After
  an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further
  revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves
  the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates
  recommendations related to topics that have only recently received
  recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and
  elaboration document—intended to enhance the use, understanding, and
  dissemination of the CONSORT statement—has also been extensively revised.
  It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item
  providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to
  relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams …%

    {$<$}p{$>$}SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for
  Interventional Trials) 2013 provides guidance for clinical trial protocol
  writing. However, neither the original guidance nor its extensions adequately
  cover the features of early phase dose-finding trials. The SPIRIT
  Dose-finding Extension (DEFINE) statement is a new guideline that provides
  recommendations for essential items that should be provided in the protocols
  of these trials. It details extensions to the SPIRIT 2013 guidance,
  incorporating 17 new items and modifying 15 existing items. The purpose of
  this guideline is to promote transparency, completeness, reproducibility of
  methods, and interpretation of early phase dose-finding trial protocols. It
  is envisioned that the resulting improvements in the design and conduct of
  early phase clinical trials will ultimately reduce research inefficiencies
  and inconsistencies, driving transformational advances in clinical
  care.{$<$}/p{$>$}%

    {$<$}p{$>$}The CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) 2010
  statement is the standard guideline for reporting completed randomised
  trials. The CONSORT Dose-finding Extension (DEFINE) extends the guidance
  (with 21 new items and 19 modified items) to early phase dose-finding trials
  with interim dose escalation or de-escalation strategies. Such trials
  generally focus on safety, tolerability, activity, and recommending dosing
  and scheduling regimens for further clinical development. These trials are
  often inadequately reported, hampering their informativeness and making
  evidence informed decisions difficult. The CONSORT-DEFINE guidance aims to
  develop an international, consensus driven guideline for reporting early
  phase dose-finding trials to promote transparency, completeness,
  reproducibility, and facilitate the interpretation of the results. The
  CONSORT-DEFINE guidance provides recommendations for essential items that
  should be reported in early phase dose-finding trials to promote greater
  clarity, reproducibility, informativeness, and usefulness of
  results.{$<$}/p{$>$}%

    Due to the staggered entry of subjects in phase I trials, some subjects
  will only be partially through the study when others are ready to be
  enrolled. Nonetheless, many phase I designs focus solely upon whether or not
  subjects experience toxicity, thereby determining the maximum tolerated dose
  (MTD) with a binomial likelihood using data from fully observed subjects. The
  time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was the first attempt
  to incorporate information from partially observed subjects by using a
  weighted binomial likelihood in which the weights are based upon the actual
  toxicity time distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately
  estimate the toxicity time distribution because only a small proportion of
  enrolled subjects will experience toxicity. Creators of the TITE-CRM propose
  the simple alternative of weighting subjects by the proportion of time
  observed, as well as two adaptive weights to adjust for late-onset
  toxicities. As a alternative to these approaches, we suggest assuming the
  toxicity times, as a proportion of the total time under observation, have a
  Beta distribution with parameters 1.0 and theta; we also allow theta to vary
  by dose. The value of theta allows us to reflect the occurrence of early- or
  late-onset toxicities without correctly specifying the actual distribution of
  toxicity times. Through this model, we do not necessarily expect to improve
  identification of the MTD, but rather hope to reduce the exposure of subjects
  to overly toxic doses. Through simulation, we examine how well our model
  identifies the MTD and allocates dose assignments in three scenarios
  investigated by previous publications.%

    Awareness of model-based designs for dose-finding studies such as the
  Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) is now becoming more commonplace amongst
  clinicians, statisticians and trial management staff. In some settings
  toxicities can occur a long time after treatment has finished, resulting in
  extremely long, interrupted, CRM design trials. The Time-to-Event CRM
  (TiTE-CRM), a modification to the original CRM, accounts for the timing of
  late-onset toxicities and results in shorter trial duration. In this article,
  we discuss how to design and deliver a trial using this method, from the
  grant application stage through to dissemination, using two radiotherapy
  trials as examples.%

    Traditionally, Phase II trials have been conducted as single-arm trials to
  compare the response probabilities between an experimental therapy and a
  historical control. Historical control data, however, often have a small
  sample size, are collected from a different patient population, or use a
  different response assessment method, so that a direct comparison between a
  historical control and an experimental therapy may be severely biased.
  Randomized Phase II trials entering patients prospectively to both
  experimental and control arms have been proposed to avoid any bias in such
  cases. The small sample sizes for typical Phase II clinical trials imply that
  the use of exact statistical methods for their design and analysis is
  appropriate. In this article, we propose two-stage randomized Phase II trials
  based on Fisher’s exact test, which does not require specification of the
  response probability of the control arm for testing. Through numerical
  studies, we observe that the proposed method controls the type I error
  accurately and maintains a high power. If we specify the response
  probabilities of the two arms under the alternative hypothesis, we can
  identify good randomized Phase II trial designs by adopting the Simon’s
  minimax and optimal design concepts that were developed for single-arm Phase
  II trials.%

    The primary objective of a phase II clinical trial of a new drug or regimen
  is to determine whether it has sufficient biological activity against the
  disease under study to warrant more extensive development. Such trials are
  often conducted in a multi-institution setting where designs of more than two
  stages are difficult to manage. This paper presents two-stage designs that
  are optimal in the sense that the expected sample size is minimized if the
  regimen has low activity subject to constraints upon the size of the type 1
  and type 2 errors. Two-stage designs which minimize the maximum sample size
  are also determined. Optimum and “minimax” designs for a range of design
  parameters are tabulated. These designs can also be used for pilot studies of
  new regimens where toxicity is the endpoint of interest.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The low productivity and escalating costs of drug development have been
  well documented over the past several years. Less than 10\% of new compounds
  that enter clinical trials ultimately make it to the market, and many more
  fail in the preclinical stages of development. These challenges in the
  “critical path” of drug development are discussed in a 2004 publication
  by the US Food and Drug Administration. The document emphasizes new tools and
  various opportunities to improve drug development. One of the opportunities
  recommended is the application of “model-based drug development (MBDD).”
  This paper discusses what constitutes the key elements of MBDD and how these
  elements should fit together to inform drug development strategy and
  decision-making. Clinical Pharmacology \& Therapeutics (2007) 82, 21–32.

    Background Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a powerful analysis method used
  to identify the best treatments for a condition and is used extensively by
  health care decision makers. Although software routines exist for conducting
  NMA, they require considerable statistical programming expertise to use,
  which limits the number of researchers able to conduct such analyses.
  Objectives To develop a web-based tool allowing users with only standard
  internet browser software to be able to conduct NMAs using an intuitive
  “point and click” interface and present the results using visual plots.
  Methods Using the existing netmeta and Shiny packages for R to conduct the
  analyses, and to develop the user interface, we created the MetaInsight tool
  which is freely available to use via the web. Results A package was created
  for conducting NMA which satisfied our objectives, and this is described, and
  its application demonstrated, using an illustrative example. Conclusions We
  believe that many researchers will find our package helpful for facilitating
  NMA as well as allowing decision makers to scrutinize presented results
  visually and in real time. This will impact on the relevance of statistical
  analyses for health care decision making and sustainably increase capacity by
  empowering informed nonspecialists to be able to conduct more clinically
  relevant reviews. It is also hoped that others will be inspired to create
  similar tools for other advanced specialist analyses methods using the freely
  available technologies we have adopted.%

    Recommended statistical methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic test
  accuracy studies require relatively complex bivariate statistical models
  which can be a barrier for non-statisticians. A further barrier exists in the
  software options available for fitting such models. Software accessible to
  non-statisticians, such as RevMan, does not support the fitting of bivariate
  models thus users must seek statistical support to use R, Stata or SAS.
  Recent advances in web technologies make analysis tool creation much simpler
  than previously. As well as accessibility, online tools can allow tailored
  interactivity not found in other packages allowing multiple perspectives of
  data to be displayed and information to be tailored to the user’s
  preference from a simple interface. We set out to: (i) Develop a freely
  available web-based “point and click” interactive tool which allows users
  to input their DTA study data and conduct meta-analyses for DTA reviews,
  including sensitivity analyses. (ii) Illustrate the features and benefits of
  the interactive application using an existing DTA meta-analysis for detecting
  dementia.%

    Diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews are conducted to
  summarize evidence on the accuracy of a diagnostic test including a critical
  evaluation of the primary studies. Where appropriate, the evidence is
  meta-analyzed to obtain pooled estimates of effectiveness.In this study, we
  reviewed and critiqued three DTA guidance documents with respect to the
  graphical presentation of DTA meta-analysis results. All three documents
  recommended the use of two forms of graphical presentation: (a) forest plots
  displaying meta-analysis results for sensitivity (ie, the true positive rate)
  and specificity (ie, true negative rate) separately, and (b) Summary Receiver
  Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve to provide a global summary of test
  performance. Two primary shortcomings were identified: (a) lack of
  incorporation of quality assessment results into the main analysis and; (b)
  ambiguity with which the contribution of individual studies is represented on
  SROC curves. In response, two alternative graphical approaches were
  developed: A quality assessment enhanced SROC plot which displays the results
  from individual studies in the meta-analysis with multiple indicators of
  quality assessed using QUADAS-2; and A percentage study weights enhanced SROC
  plot which accurately portrays the percentage contribution each study makes
  to the meta-analysis. The proposed enhanced SROC curves facilitate the
  exploration of DTA data, leading to a deeper understanding of the primary
  studies included in a DTA meta-analysis including identifying reasons for
  between study heterogeneity and why specific study results may be divergent.
  Both plots can easily be produced in the free online interactive application,
  MetaDTA (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/dta\_ma/).%

    Background/aims In our 2009 article, we showed that Bayesian methods had
  established a foothold in developing therapies in our institutional oncology
  trials. In this article, we will document what has happened since that time.
  In addition, we will describe barriers to implementing Bayesian clinical
  trials, as well as our experience overcoming them. Methods We reviewed MD
  Anderson Cancer Center clinical trials submitted to the institutional
  protocol office for scientific and ethical review between January 2009 and
  December 2013, the same length time period as the previous article. We
  tabulated Bayesian methods implemented for design or analyses for each trial
  and then compared these to our previous findings. Results Overall, we
  identified 1020 trials and found that 283 (28\%) had Bayesian components so
  we designated them as Bayesian trials. Among MD Anderson–only and
  multicenter trials, 56\% and 14\%, respectively, were Bayesian, higher rates
  than our previous study. Bayesian trials were more common in phase I/II
  trials (34\%) than in phase III/IV (6\%) trials. Among Bayesian trials, the
  most commonly used features were for toxicity monitoring (65\%), efficacy
  monitoring (36\%), and dose finding (22\%). The majority (86\%) of Bayesian
  trials used non-informative priors. A total of 75 (27\%) trials applied
  Bayesian methods for trial design and primary endpoint analysis. Among this
  latter group, the most commonly used methods were the Bayesian logistic
  regression model (N\,=\,22), the continual reassessment method (N\,=\,20),
  and adaptive randomization (N\,=\,16). Median institutional review board
  approval time from protocol submission was the same 1.4\,months for Bayesian
  and non-Bayesian trials. Since the previous publication, the
  Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer
  Elimination (BATTLE) trial was the first large-scale decision trial combining
  multiple treatments in a single trial. Since then, two regimens in breast
  cancer therapy have been identified and published from the cooperative
  Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with
  Imaging and Molecular Analysis (I-SPY 2), enhancing cooperation among
  investigators and drug developers across the nation, as well as advancing
  information needed for personalized medicine. Many software programs and
  Shiny applications for Bayesian trial design and calculations are available
  from our website which has had more than 21,000 downloads worldwide since
  2004. Conclusion Bayesian trials have the increased flexibility in trial
  design needed for personalized medicine, resulting in more cooperation among
  researchers working to fight against cancer. Some disadvantages of Bayesian
  trials remain, but new methods and software are available to improve their
  function and incorporation into cancer clinical research.%

    In phase I cancer clinical trials, the maximum tolerated dose of a new drug
  is often found by a dose-escalation method known as the A + B design. We have
  developed an interactive web application, AplusB, which computes and returns
  exact operating characteristics of A + B trial designs. The application has a
  graphical user interface (GUI), requires no programming knowledge and is free
  to access and use on any device that can open an internet browser. A
  customised report is available for download for each design that contains
  tabulated operating characteristics and informative plots, which can then be
  compared with other dose-escalation methods. We present a step-by-step guide
  on how to use this application and provide several illustrative examples of
  its capabilities.%

    Although there are several new designs for phase I cancer clinical trials
  including the continual reassessment method and accelerated titration design,
  the traditional algorithm‐based designs, like the ‘3 + 3’ design, are
  still widely used because of their practical simplicity. In this paper, we
  study some key statistical properties of the traditional algorithm‐based
  designs in a general framework and derive the exact formulae for the
  corresponding statistical quantities. These quantities are important for the
  investigator to gain insights regarding the design of the trial, and are (i)
  the probability of a dose being chosen as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD);
  (ii) the expected number of patients treated at each dose level; (iii) target
  toxicity level (i.e. the expected dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) incidences
  at the MTD); (iv) expected DLT incidences at each dose level and (v) expected
  overall DLT incidences in the trial. Real examples of clinical trials are
  given, and a computer program to do the calculation can be found at the
  authors' website http://www2.umdnj.edu/∼linyo.%

    Background/aims: Dose-escalation studies are essential in the early stages
  of developing novel treatments, when the aim is to find a safe dose for
  administration in humans. Despite their great importance, many
  dose-escalation studies use study designs based on heuristic algorithms with
  well-documented drawbacks. Bayesian decision procedures provide a design
  alternative that is conceptually simple and methodologically sound, but very
  rarely used in practice, at least in part due to their perceived statistical
  complexity. There are currently very few easily accessible software
  implementations that would facilitate their application. Methods: We have
  created MoDEsT, a free and easy-to-use web application for designing and
  conducting single-agent dose-escalation studies with a binary toxicity
  endpoint, where the objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose.
  MoDEsT uses a well-established Bayesian decision procedure based on logistic
  regression. The software has a user-friendly point-and-click interface, makes
  changes visible in real time, and automatically generates a range of graphs,
  tables, and reports. It is aimed at clinicians as well as statisticians with
  limited expertise in model-based dose-escalation designs, and does not
  require any statistical programming skills to evaluate the operating
  characteristics of, or implement, the Bayesian dose-escalation design.
  Results: MoDEsT comes in two parts: a ‘Design’ module to explore design
  options and simulate their operating characteristics, and a ‘Conduct’
  module to guide the dose-finding process throughout the study. We illustrate
  the practical use of both modules with data from a real phase I study in
  terminal cancer. Conclusion: Enabling both methodologists and clinicians to
  understand and apply model-based study designs with ease is a key factor
  towards their routine use in early-phase studies. We hope that MoDEsT will
  enable incorporation of Bayesian decision procedures for dose escalation at
  the earliest stage of clinical trial design, thus increasing their use in
  early-phase trials.%

    Multi-arm designs provide an effective means of evaluating several

    Technology plays a critical role in supporting statistics education, and
  student comprehension is improved when simulations accompanied by dynamic
  visualizations are employed. Many web-based teaching tool applets programmed
  in Java/Javascript are publicly available (e.g., www.rossmanchance.com,
  www.socr.ucla.edu). These provide a user-friendly interface which is
  accessible and appealing to students in introductory statistics courses.
  However, not all statistics educators are fluent in Java/Javascript and may
  not be able to tailor these apps or develop their own. Shiny, a web
  application framework for R created by RStudio, facilitates applet
  development for educators who are familiar with R. We illustrate the utility,
  convenience, and versatility of Shiny through our collection of 17 freely
  available apps covering a range of topics and levels (found at
  www.statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny). Our Shiny source code is publicly
  available so that anyone may tailor our apps as desired. We provide feedback
  on how our apps have been used in statistics classes including some
  challenges that were encountered. We also discuss feasibility on building,
  launching, and deploying Shiny apps. A brief tutorial on installing and using
  Shiny is provided in the appendix. Some teaching materials based on our Shiny
  apps are also included in the appendix.%

    We propose a flexible Bayesian optimal phase II (BOP2) design that is
  capable of handling simple (e.g., binary) and complicated (e.g., ordinal,
  nested, and co-primary) endpoints under a unified framework. We use a
  Dirichlet-multinomial model to accommodate different types of endpoints. At
  each interim, the go/no-go decision is made by evaluating a set of posterior
  probabilities of the events of interest, which is optimized to maximize power
  or minimize the number of patients under the null hypothesis. Unlike other
  existing Bayesian designs, the BOP2 design explicitly controls the type I
  error rate, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian designs and frequentist
  designs. In addition, the stopping boundary of the BOP2 design can be
  enumerated prior to the onset of the trial. These features make the BOP2
  design accessible to a wide range of users and regulatory agencies and
  particularly easy to implement in practice. Simulation studies show that the
  BOP2 design has favorable operating characteristics with higher power and
  lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some existing Bayesian
  phase II designs. The software to implement the BOP2 design is freely
  available at www.trialdesign.org. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We propose a Bayesian optimal phase II (BOP2) design for clinical trials
  with a time-to-event endpoint (eg, progression-free survival [PFS]) or
  co-primary endpoints consisted of a time-to-event endpoint and a categorical
  endpoint (eg, PFS and toxicity). We use an exponential-inverse gamma model to
  model the time to event. At each interim, the go/no-go decision is made by
  comparing the posterior probabilities of the event of interest with an
  adaptive probability cutoff. The BOP2 design is flexible in the number of
  interim looks and applicable to both single-arm and two-arm trials. The
  design maximizes the power for detecting effective treatments, with a
  well-controlled type I error, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian
  designs and frequentist designs. The BOP2 design is easy to implement. Its
  stopping boundary can be enumerated and included in study protocol before the
  onset of the trial for single-arm studies. Simulation studies show that the
  BOP2 design has favorable operating characteristics, with higher power and
  lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some Bayesian phase II
  designs. The software to implement the BOP2 design will be freely available
