abstract = {The time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was proposed to handle the problem of long trial duration in Phase1 trials as a result of late-onset toxicities. Here, we implement the TITE-CRM in dose-finding trials of combinations of agents. When studying multiple agents, monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve is not clearly defined. Therefore, the toxicity probabilities follow a partial order, meaning that there are pairs of treatments for which the ordering of the toxicity probabilities is not known at the start of the trial. A CRM design for partially ordered trials (PO-CRM) was recently proposed. Simulation studies show that extending the TITE-CRM to the partial order setting produces results similar to those of the PO-CRM in terms of maximum tolerated dose recommendation yet reduces the duration of the trial. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We discuss an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM) for use in phase I dose-finding studies. The extension enables the method to be applied to two groups of patients to determine the appropriate dose levels for each group. The method takes the specification of a simple relationship between the dose-toxicity curves for the two groups and runs the CRM on the bivariate model using maximum likelihood. We prove consistency of the method under fairly weak conditions and provide several simulations to give an idea how the method works in practice. We also undertake an evaluation of its performance by considering three possible situations: The first is the two- sample CRM, which directly uses a working model for the relationship between the two groups, carrying out a single trial using this method; the second situation carries out single trials for each of the two groups separately using the original (one-sample) CRM. The third situation is the case where such heterogeneity is ignored and the two groups are pooled into a single group, again using the original (one-sample) CRM. Simulations are carried out under a large class of model misspecifications, both of the dose-toxicity relationships and of the functional form linking the groups, and are backed up by asymptotic results. Our conclusions match intuition: The first scheme gives the most favorable results when the two groups are different but share some features. When the groups are very different, the second scheme performs similarly to the first for finite sample sizes while having some advantages in terms of asymptotic efficiency. The third, as expected, gives the best results in the absence of patient heterogeneity. The two-sample method appears particularly advantageous when there may not be enough subjects in one of the subgroups for it to be feasible to carry out two trials.},

abstract = {Traditionally, Phase I oncology trials evaluate the safety profile of a novel agent and identify a maximum tolerable dose based on toxicity alone. With the development of biologically targeted agents, investigators believe the efficacy of a novel agent may plateau or diminish before reaching the maximum tolerable dose while toxicity continues to increase. This motivates dose-finding based on the simultaneous evaluation of toxicity and efficacy. Previously, we investigated hierarchical modeling in the context of Phase I dose-escalation studies for multiple populations and found borrowing strength across populations improved operating characteristics. In this article, we discuss three hierarchical extensions to commonly used probability models for efficacy and toxicity in Phase I-II trials and adapt our previously proposed dose-finding algorithm for multiple populations to this setting. First, we consider both parametric and non-parametric bivariate models for binary outcomes and, in addition, we consider an under-parameterized model that combines toxicity and efficacy into a single trinary outcome. Our simulation results indicate hierarchical modeling increases the probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose and increases the average number of patients treated at the optimal dose, with the under-parameterized hierarchical model displaying desirable and robust operating characteristics.},

abstract = {Background:Dose-finding trials are essential to drug development as they establish recommended doses for later-phase testing. We aim to motivate wider use of model-based designs for dose finding, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM).Methods:We carried out a literature review of dose-finding designs and conducted a survey to identify perceived barriers to their implementation.Results:We describe the benefits of model-based designs (flexibility, superior operating characteristics, extended scope), their current uptake, and existing resources. The most prominent barriers to implementation of a model-based design were lack of suitable training, chief investigators' preference for algorithm-based designs (e.g., 3+3), and limited resources for study design before funding. We use a real-world example to illustrate how these barriers can be overcome.Conclusions:There is overwhelming evidence for the benefits of CRM. Many leading pharmaceutical companies routinely implement model-based designs. Our analysis identified barriers for academic statisticians and clinical academics in mirroring the progress industry has made in trial design. Unified support from funders, regulators, and journal editors could result in more accurate doses for later-phase testing, and increase the efficiency and success of clinical drug development. We give recommendations for increasing the uptake of model-based designs for dose-finding trials in academia.},

@article{Ananthakrishnan2017,
abstract = {Dose finding Phase I oncology designs can be broadly categorized as rule based, such as the 3 + 3 and the accelerated titration designs, or model based, such as the CRM and Eff-Tox designs. This paper systematically reviews and compares through simulations several statistical operating characteristics, including the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) selection, the percentage of patients assigned to the MTD, over-dosing, under-dosing, and the trial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, of eleven rule-based and model-based Phase I oncology designs that target or pre-specify a DLT rate of ∼0.2, for three sets of true DLT probabilities. These DLT probabilities are generated at common dosages from specific linear, logistic, and log-logistic dose-toxicity curves. We find that all the designs examined select the MTD much more accurately when there is a clear separation between the true DLT rate at the MTD and the rates at the dose level immediately above and below it, such as for the DLT rates generated using the chosen logistic dose-toxicity curve; the separations in these true DLT rates depend, in turn, not only on the functional form of the dose-toxicity curve but also on the investigated dose levels and the parameter set-up. The model based mTPI, TEQR, BOIN, CRM and EWOC designs perform well and assign the greatest percentages of patients to the MTD, and also have a reasonably high probability of picking the true MTD across the three dose-toxicity curves examined. Among the rule-based designs studied, the 5 + 5 a design picks the MTD as accurately as the model based designs for the true DLT rates generated using the chosen log-logistic and linear dose-toxicity curves, but requires enrolling a higher number of patients than the other designs. We also find that it is critical to pick a design that is aligned with the true DLT rate of interest. Further, we note that Phase I trials are very small in general and hence may not provide accurate estimates of the MTD. Thus our work provides a map for planning Phase I oncology trials or developing new ones.},

abstract = {Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2-4 years by our method.},

abstract = {Background: Limited options are available for dose-finding clinical trials requiring group-specific dose selection. While conducting parallel trials for groups is an accessible approach to group-specific dose selection, this approach allows for maximum tolerated dose selection that does not align with clinically meaningful group order information. Methods: The two-stage continual reassessment method is developed for dose-finding in studies involving three or more groups where group frailty order is known between some but not all groups, creating a partial order. This is an extension of the existing continual reassessment method shift model for two ordered groups. This method allows for dose selection by group, where maximum tolerated dose selection follows the known frailty order among groups. For example, if a group is known to be the most frail, the recommended maximum tolerated dose for this group should not exceed the maximum tolerated dose recommended for any other group. Results: With limited alternatives for dose-finding in partially ordered groups, this method is compared to two alternatives: (1) an existing method for dose-finding in partially ordered groups which is less computationally accessible and (2) independent trials for each group using the two-stage continual reassessment method. Simulation studies show that when ignoring information on group frailty, using independent continual reassessment method trials by group, 30{\%} of simulations would result in maximum tolerated dose selection that is out of order between groups. In addition, the two-stage continual reassessment method for partially ordered groups selects the maximum tolerated dose more often and assigns more patients to the maximum tolerated dose compared to using independent continual reassessment method trials within each group. Simulation results for the proposed method and the less computationally accessible approach are similar. Conclusion: The proposed continual reassessment method for partially ordered groups ensures appropriate maximum tolerated dose order and improves accuracy of maximum tolerated dose selection, while allowing for trial implementation that is computationally accessible.},

abstract = {Purpose: Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice. Methods: We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs. Results: One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6{\%} of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method. Conclusion: A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35{\%} of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55{\%} for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity. {\textcopyright} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Introduction: The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a model-based design for phase I trials, which aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new therapy. The CRM has been shown to be more accurate in targeting the MTD than traditional rule-based approaches such as the 3 + 3 design, which is used in most phase I trials. Furthermore, the CRM has been shown to assign more trial participants at or close to the MTD than the 3 + 3 design. However, the CRM's uptake in clinical research has been incredibly slow, putting trial participants, drug development and patients at risk. Barriers to increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available. Furthermore, practical resources to support clinicians considering the CRM for their trials are scarce. Methods: To help overcome these barriers, we present a structured framework for designing a dose-finding study using the CRM. We give recommendations for key design parameters and advise on conducting pre-trial simulation work to tailor the design to a specific trial. We provide practical tools to support clinicians and statisticians, including software recommendations, and template text and tables that can be edited and inserted into a trial protocol. We also give guidance on how to conduct and report dose-finding studies using the CRM. Results: An initial set of design recommendations are provided to kick-start the design process. To complement these and the additional resources, we describe two published dose-finding trials that used the CRM. We discuss their designs, how they were conducted and analysed, and compare them to what would have happened under a 3 + 3 design. Conclusions: The framework and resources we provide are aimed at clinicians and statisticians new to the CRM design. Provision of key resources in this contemporary guidance paper will hopefully improve the uptake of the CRM in phase I dose-finding trials.},

These methods are often proposed to address the conventional cytotoxic therapeutics for neoplastic diseases and cancer. Recent advances in precision medicine have motivated novel trial designs, most notably the idea of master protocol (eg, platform trial, basket trial, umbrella trial, N-of-1 trial), for the evaluation of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. In this article, we review the concepts and methodology of early-phase cancer trial designs with a focus on dose finding and treatment screening and put these methods in the context of platform trials of molecularly targeted cancer therapies. Because most cancer trial designs have been developed for cytotoxic agents, we will discuss how these time-tested design principles hold relevance for targeted cancer therapies, and we will delineate how a master protocol may serve as an efficient platform for safety and efficacy evaluations of novel targeted therapies.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9{\%}) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4{\%}; range 2.3{\%} in 2009 to 9.7{\%} in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8{\%} used model-based methods, compared to 3.9{\%} and 8.3{\%} of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

abstract = {The primary goal of a phase I clinical trial in oncology is to evaluate the safety of a novel treatment and identify the maximum tolerated dose, defined as the maximum dose with a toxicity rate below some pre-specified threshold. Researchers are often interested in evaluating the performance of a novel treatment in multiple patient populations, which may require multiple phase I trials if the treatment is to be used with background standard-of-care that varies by population. An alternate approach is to run parallel trials but combine the data through a hierarchical model that allows for a different maximum tolerated dose in each population but shares information across populations to achieve a more accurate estimate of the maximum tolerated dose. In this manuscript, we discuss hierarchical extensions of three commonly used models for the dose–toxicity relationship in phase I oncology trials. We then propose three dose-finding guidelines for phase I oncology trials using hierarchical modeling. The proposed guidelines allow us to fully realize the benefits of hierarchical modeling while achieving a similar toxicity profile to standard phase I designs. Finally, we evaluate the operating characteristics of a phase I clinical trial using the proposed hierarchical models and dose-finding guidelines by simulation. Our simulation results suggest that incorporating hierarchical modeling in phase I dose-escalation studies will increase the probability of correctly identifying the maximum tolerated dose and the number of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose, while decreasing the rate of dose-limiting toxicities and number of patients treated above the maximum tolerated dose, in most cases.},

abstract = {We investigate the two-group continual reassessment method for a dose-finding study in which we anticipate some ordering between the groups. This is a situation in which, for either group, we have little or almost no knowledge about which of the available dose levels will correspond to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), but we may have quite strong knowledge concerning which of the two groups will have the higher level of MTD, if indeed they do not have the same MTD. The motivation for studying this problem came from an investigation into a new therapy for acute leukemia in children. The background to this study is discussed. There were two groups of patients: one group already received heavy prior therapy while the second group had received relatively much lighter prior therapy. It was therefore anticipated that the second group would have an MTD higher or at least as high as the first. Generally, likelihood methods or, equivalently, the use of noninformative Bayes priors, can be used to model the main aspects of the study, i.e., the MTD for one of the groups, reserving more informative Bayes modeling to be applied to the secondary features of the study. These secondary features may simply be the direction of the difference between the MTD levels for the two groups or, possibly, information on the potential gap between the two MTDs.},
