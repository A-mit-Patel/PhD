Stemming from this theoretical framework are a number of results and some further development, in particular the way to structure a randomized allocation of subjects as well as a more robust approach to the problem of dealing with patient heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Introduction: The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a model-based design for phase I trials, which aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new therapy. The CRM has been shown to be more accurate in targeting the MTD than traditional rule-based approaches such as the 3 + 3 design, which is used in most phase I trials. Furthermore, the CRM has been shown to assign more trial participants at or close to the MTD than the 3 + 3 design. However, the CRM's uptake in clinical research has been incredibly slow, putting trial participants, drug development and patients at risk. Barriers to increasing the use of the CRM have been identified, most notably a lack of knowledge amongst clinicians and statisticians on how to apply new designs in practice. No recent tutorial, guidelines, or recommendations for clinicians on conducting dose-finding studies using the CRM are available. Furthermore, practical resources to support clinicians considering the CRM for their trials are scarce. Methods: To help overcome these barriers, we present a structured framework for designing a dose-finding study using the CRM. We give recommendations for key design parameters and advise on conducting pre-trial simulation work to tailor the design to a specific trial. We provide practical tools to support clinicians and statisticians, including software recommendations, and template text and tables that can be edited and inserted into a trial protocol. We also give guidance on how to conduct and report dose-finding studies using the CRM. Results: An initial set of design recommendations are provided to kick-start the design process. To complement these and the additional resources, we describe two published dose-finding trials that used the CRM. We discuss their designs, how they were conducted and analysed, and compare them to what would have happened under a 3 + 3 design. Conclusions: The framework and resources we provide are aimed at clinicians and statisticians new to the CRM design. Provision of key resources in this contemporary guidance paper will hopefully improve the uptake of the CRM in phase I dose-finding trials.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3+3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, deescalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determinehowstringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transitionfor each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.},

abstract = {Traditional phase I studies find the therapeutic dose of an investigational drug based solely on toxicity and without regard to the drug's efficacy. We propose extending the continual reassessment method (CRM) to a bivariate trial design in which the maximum tolerated dose is based jointly on both toxicity and disease progression. We call our study design bCRM, for bivariate CRM, which we apply to a study of bone marrow patients seeking to find the optimal time after bone marrow transplant at which to taper immune suppression and eventually begin donor leukocyte infusions. We demonstrate through simulation that bCRM has excellent operating characteristics and compare the performance of bCRM in a bone marrow transplantation study to designs proposed by previous investigators. We also attempt to provide some direction to future investigators with regard to plausible models and distributions to use with a bivariate study design. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

@article{Cheung2000,
abstract = {Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2-4 years by our method.},

@article{OQuigley1999,
abstract = {We discuss an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM) for use in phase I dose-finding studies. The extension enables the method to be applied to two groups of patients to determine the appropriate dose levels for each group. The method takes the specification of a simple relationship between the dose-toxicity curves for the two groups and runs the CRM on the bivariate model using maximum likelihood. We prove consistency of the method under fairly weak conditions and provide several simulations to give an idea how the method works in practice. We also undertake an evaluation of its performance by considering three possible situations: The first is the two- sample CRM, which directly uses a working model for the relationship between the two groups, carrying out a single trial using this method; the second situation carries out single trials for each of the two groups separately using the original (one-sample) CRM. The third situation is the case where such heterogeneity is ignored and the two groups are pooled into a single group, again using the original (one-sample) CRM. Simulations are carried out under a large class of model misspecifications, both of the dose-toxicity relationships and of the functional form linking the groups, and are backed up by asymptotic results. Our conclusions match intuition: The first scheme gives the most favorable results when the two groups are different but share some features. When the groups are very different, the second scheme performs similarly to the first for finite sample sizes while having some advantages in terms of asymptotic efficiency. The third, as expected, gives the best results in the absence of patient heterogeneity. The two-sample method appears particularly advantageous when there may not be enough subjects in one of the subgroups for it to be feasible to carry out two trials.},

@article{Wages2011,
abstract = {Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990,Biometrics46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders. {\textcopyright} 2011, The International Biometric Society.},
