abstract = {Dose finding Phase I oncology designs can be broadly categorized as rule based, such as the 3 + 3 and the accelerated titration designs, or model based, such as the CRM and Eff-Tox designs. This paper systematically reviews and compares through simulations several statistical operating characteristics, including the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) selection, the percentage of patients assigned to the MTD, over-dosing, under-dosing, and the trial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, of eleven rule-based and model-based Phase I oncology designs that target or pre-specify a DLT rate of ∼0.2, for three sets of true DLT probabilities. These DLT probabilities are generated at common dosages from specific linear, logistic, and log-logistic dose-toxicity curves. We find that all the designs examined select the MTD much more accurately when there is a clear separation between the true DLT rate at the MTD and the rates at the dose level immediately above and below it, such as for the DLT rates generated using the chosen logistic dose-toxicity curve; the separations in these true DLT rates depend, in turn, not only on the functional form of the dose-toxicity curve but also on the investigated dose levels and the parameter set-up. The model based mTPI, TEQR, BOIN, CRM and EWOC designs perform well and assign the greatest percentages of patients to the MTD, and also have a reasonably high probability of picking the true MTD across the three dose-toxicity curves examined. Among the rule-based designs studied, the 5 + 5 a design picks the MTD as accurately as the model based designs for the true DLT rates generated using the chosen log-logistic and linear dose-toxicity curves, but requires enrolling a higher number of patients than the other designs. We also find that it is critical to pick a design that is aligned with the true DLT rate of interest. Further, we note that Phase I trials are very small in general and hence may not provide accurate estimates of the MTD. Thus our work provides a map for planning Phase I oncology trials or developing new ones.},

abstract = {Background:Dose-finding trials are essential to drug development as they establish recommended doses for later-phase testing. We aim to motivate wider use of model-based designs for dose finding, such as the continual reassessment method (CRM).Methods:We carried out a literature review of dose-finding designs and conducted a survey to identify perceived barriers to their implementation.Results:We describe the benefits of model-based designs (flexibility, superior operating characteristics, extended scope), their current uptake, and existing resources. The most prominent barriers to implementation of a model-based design were lack of suitable training, chief investigators' preference for algorithm-based designs (e.g., 3+3), and limited resources for study design before funding. We use a real-world example to illustrate how these barriers can be overcome.Conclusions:There is overwhelming evidence for the benefits of CRM. Many leading pharmaceutical companies routinely implement model-based designs. Our analysis identified barriers for academic statisticians and clinical academics in mirroring the progress industry has made in trial design. Unified support from funders, regulators, and journal editors could result in more accurate doses for later-phase testing, and increase the efficiency and success of clinical drug development. We give recommendations for increasing the uptake of model-based designs for dose-finding trials in academia.},

abstract = {A number of novel phase I trial designs have been proposed that aim to combine the simplicity of algorithm-based designs with the superior performance of model-based designs, including the modified toxicity probability interval, Bayesian optimal interval, and Keyboard designs. In this article, we review these “model-assisted” designs, contrast their statistical foundations and pros and cons, and compare their operating characteristics with the continual reassessment method. To provide unbiased and reliable results, our comparison is based on 10 000 dose-toxicity scenarios randomly generated using the pseudo-uniform algorithm recently proposed in the literature. The results showed that the continual reassessment method, Bayesian optimal interval, and Keyboard designs provide comparable, superior operating characteristics, and each outperforms the modified toxicity probability interval design. These designs are more likely to correctly select the maximum tolerated dose and less likely to overdose patients.},

abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are an essential step in the development of anticancer drugs. The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics. 2009 The Author(s).2009This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

@article{Chiuzan2017,
abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of early phase trials of molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) and immunotherapies. These new therapies have different toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic therapies. MTAs can benefit from new trial designs that allow inclusion of low-grade toxicities, late-onset toxicities, addition of an efficacy endpoint, and flexibility in the specification of a target toxicity probability. To study the degree of adoption of these methods, we conducted a Web of Science search of articles published between 2008 and 2014 that describe phase 1 oncology trials. Trials were categorized based on the dose-finding design used and the type of drug studied. Out of 1,712 dose-finding trials that met our criteria, 1,591 (92.9{\%}) utilized a rule-based design, and 92 (5.4{\%}; range 2.3{\%} in 2009 to 9.7{\%} in 2014) utilized a model-based or novel design. Over half of the trials tested an MTA or immunotherapy. Among the MTA and immunotherapy trials, 5.8{\%} used model-based methods, compared to 3.9{\%} and 8.3{\%} of the chemotherapy or radiotherapy trials, respectively. While the percentage of trials using novel dose-finding designs has tripled since 2007, the adoption of these designs continues to remain low.},

@article{Rogatko2007,
abstract = {Purpose: Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer therapies determine suitable doses for further testing. Optimization of their design is vital in that they enroll cancer patients whose well-being is distinctly at risk. This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge transfer about more effective statistical designs to clinical practice. Methods: We examined abstract records of cancer phase I trials from the Science Citation Index database between 1991 and 2006 and classified them into clinical (dose-finding trials) and statistical trials (methodologic studies of dose-escalation designs). We then mapped these two sets by tracking which trials adopted new statistical designs. Results: One thousand two hundred thirty-five clinical and 90 statistical studies were identified. Only 1.6{\%} of the phase I cancer trials (20 of 1,235 trials) followed a design proposed in one of the statistical studies. These 20 clinical studies showed extensive lags between publication of the statistical paper and its translation into a clinical paper. These 20 clinical trials followed Bayesian adaptive designs. The remainder used variations of the standard up-and-down method. Conclusion: A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. Simulation studies have shown that up-and-down designs treated only 35{\%} of patients at optimal dose levels versus 55{\%} for Bayesian adaptive designs. This implies needless loss of treatment efficacy and, possibly, lives. We suggest that regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration) should proactively encourage the adoption of statistical designs that would allow more patients to be treated at near-optimal doses while controlling for excessive toxicity. {\textcopyright} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},
